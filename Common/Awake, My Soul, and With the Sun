verse      A   -  wake,  my      soul, and with    the  sun
verse      By     in  -  fluence of    the Light   di - vine
verse      All    praise to      Thee, who safe    has  kept
verse      Lord,  I      my      vows  to  Thee    re - new;
verse      Praise God    from    Whom  all bless - ings flow;

verse      Thy    dai - ly   stage   of    du  -  ty   run;
verse      Let    thy   own  light   to    oth -  ers  shine.
verse      And    hast  re - freshed me    while  I    slept
verse      Dis -  perse my   sins    as    morn - ing  dew.
verse      Praise Him,  all  crea -  tures here   be - low;

verse      Shake  off   dull  sloth,   and   joy   -  ful   rise,
verse      Re  -  flect all   Heav'nâ€™s pro - pi   -   tious ways
verse      Grant, Lord, when  I        from  death    shall wake
verse      Guard  my    first springs  of    thought  and   will,
verse      Praise Him   a  -  bove,    ye    heav'n - ly    host;

verse      To     pay  thy   morn - ing  sac  -  ri -  fice.
verse      In     ar - dent  love,  and  cheer - ful   praise.
verse      I      may  of    end -  less light   par - take.
verse      And    with Thy - self   my   spi  -  rit   fill.
verse      Praise Fa - ther, Son,   and  Ho   -  ly    Ghost.
