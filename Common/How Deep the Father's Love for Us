verse      How  deep the Fa -  ther's love  for    us,    How    vast be - yond all meas  - ure,  That
verse      Be - hold the man   up  -  on    a      cross, My     sin  up - on   His shoul - ders; A -
verse      I    will not boast in     any - thing, No     gifts, no   po - wer, no  wis  -  dom;  But

verse      He      should give  His on  -  ly  Son     To   make  a   wretch His   treas - ure.   How
verse      shamed, I      hear  my  mock - ing voice   Call out   a - mong   the   scof  - fers.  It
verse      I       will   boast in  Je  -  sus Christ, His  death and re  -  sur - rec  -  tion.  Why

verse      great  the pain of   sear - ing  loss   The  Fa -  ther turns His  face   away,   As
verse      was    my  sin  that held   Him  there  Un - til   it   was   ac - comp - lished; His
verse      should I   gain from His    re - ward?  I    can - not  give  an   an  -  swer;   But

verse      wounds which mar    the  Cho  -  sen One     Bring man  - y    sons to glo -
verse      dy  -  ing   breath has  brought me  life    I     know   that it   is fin -
verse      this   I     know   with all     my  heart   His   wounds have paid my ran -
