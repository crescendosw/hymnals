verse      Kin  - dle,   Sav      - ior,   in     my     heart     A       flame     of     love   di  - vine;    Hear,    for   mine   I       trust      Thou   art,      And     sure   I    would   be     Thine.   If     my   soul    has   felt   Thy   grace,   If     to     me       Thy    name   is    known;   Why    should   trou  - bles   fill    the    place     Due    to      Thy   - self   a  - lone?     
verse      ’Tis   a      strange,   mys  - ter  - ious   life      I       live      from   day    to    day;     Light    and   dark - ness,   peace      and    strife,   Bear    an     al - ter   - nate   sway.    When   I    think   the   bat  - tle   won,     I      must   fight    it     yet    a   - gain;    When   I        think   I’m    o     - ver  - thrown,   Re   - lief    I       soon   ob - tain.     
verse      Of   - ten    at         the    mer  - cy     seat,     While   call    - ing    on     Thy   name,    Swarms   of    e    - vil     thoughts   I      meet      Which   fill   my   soul    with   shame.   Ag   - i  - tat   - ed    in     my    mind,    Like   a      fea    - ther   in     the   air,     Can    I        thus    a      bless - ing    find?     My     soul,   can     this   be   pray’r?   
verse      But    when   Christ,    my     Lord   and    Friend,   Is      pleased   to     show   His   pow’r,   All      at    once   my      trou     - bles   end,      And     I’ve   a    gold  - en     hour.    Then   I    see     His   smil - ing   face,    Feel   the    pledge   of     joys   to    come.    Of   - ten,     Lord,   re   - peat    this   grace     Till   Thou    shalt   call   me   home!
