verse      From     depths   of    woe     I     raise   to     Thee     The      voice   of     lam  - en  - ta    - tion.   Lord,   turn     a       gra   - cious   ear     to    me       And   hear    my     sup   - pli  - ca    - tion.   If    Thou    in   - iq   - ui  - ties   dost     mark,    Our   se   - cret    sins   and   mis   - deeds   dark,   Oh,    who    shall   stand   be   - fore   Thee?     
verse      To       wash     a   - way     the   crim  - son    stain,   Grace,   grace   a    - lone   a   - vail  - eth;    Our     works,   a     - las!    are     all     in    vain;    In    much    the    best    life   fail  - eth.    No    man     can    glo  - ry    in     Thy      sight,   All   must   a     - like   con - fess    Thy     might   And    live   a     - lone    by     mer  - cy.       
verse      There  - fore     my    trust   is    in      the    Lord     And      not     in     mine   own   mer   - it;.    On      Him      my      soul    shall   rest;   His   Word     Up  - holds   my     faint - ing    spir  - it.     His   prom  - ised   mer  - cy    is     my       fort,    My    com  - fort,   and    my    sweet   sup   - port;   I      wait   for     it      with   pa   - tience.   
verse      What     though   I     wait    the   live  - long   night    And      till    the    dawn   ap  - pear  - eth,    My      heart    still   trust - eth     in      His   might;   It    doubt - eth    not     nor    fear  - eth.    Do    thus,   O      ye     of    Is   - raelâ€™s   seed,    Ye    of     the     Spir - it    born    in    - deed,   And    wait   till    God     ap   - pear - eth.      
verse      Though   great    our   sins    and   sore    our    woes,    His      grace   much   more   a   - bound - eth;    His     help   - ing     love    no      lim   - it    knows,   Our   ut    - most   need    it     sound - eth.    Our   Shep  - herd   good   and   true   is       He,      Who   will   at      last   His   Is    - rael    free    From   all    his     sin     and    sor  - row.
