verse      Glo  - ry    be      to     Him      who   loved   us,     Washed   us    from    each   spot     and    stain!   Glo  - ry    be     to    Him      who   bought   us,      Made     us    kings    with   Him     to     reign!    Glo  - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry    To      the   Lamb   that   once   was   slain!
