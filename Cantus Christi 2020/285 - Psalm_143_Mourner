verse      O       hear   my      pray   - er,    LORD;   My     cry       for   mer   - cy     heed.     In     truth   and    right - eous - ness     Draw    near    to     meet    my     need.     And     do      not   judge    me     in       Your   sight    For   in      Your    pres    - ence   none    is     right.   
verse      The     foe    has     hound  - ed     me      And    crushed   me    to      the    ground,   In     dark  - ness   made    me     dwell,   Like    those   in     death   long   bound.    And     so      my    spir   - it     is       a    - fraid;   My    heart   with  - in        me     is      dis  - mayed.   
verse      There - fore   I       call     to     mind    The    days      and   years   long   gone;     I      pon   - der    all     Your   works    And     what    Your   hands   have   done.     To      You     in    pray’r   I      spread   my     hands;   For   You     I       thirst,   like   ar    - id     lands.   
verse      My      spir - it      fails,   O      LORD;   Come   quick   - ly    to      my     side.     Hide   not     Your   face    from   me,      Lest    to      the    pit     I      slide.    Let     morn  - ing   bring    Your   love     a    - new,     For   I       have    put       my     trust   in     You.     
verse      To      You    I       lift     my     soul;   Show   me        the   way     to     go.       I      hide    my   - self    in     You;     LORD,   save    me     from    my     foe.      Teach   me,     my    God,     to     do       Your   will;    May   Your    good    Spir    - it     lead    me     still.   
verse      For     Your   great   mer    - cy’s   sake,   O      LORD,     pre - serve   my     life;     And    in      Your   right - eous - ness     De    - liv   - er     me      from   strife.   In      love,   put   all      my     foes     to     shame;   De  - stroy   them,   for       I      bear    Your   name.
