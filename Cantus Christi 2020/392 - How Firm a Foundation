verse      How     firm      a      foun - da   - tion,   ye     saints   of     the     Lord,    Is    laid     for       your   faith   in       His     ex     - cel  - lent   Word!   What   more       can      He      say     than     to      you     He     hath   said,    To     you     who,   for     re    - fuge,   to    Je   - sus   hath   fled.    
verse      “Fear   not,      I      am     with   thee,   O      be       not    dis   - mayed,   For   I        am        thy    God     and      will    still    give   thee   aid.    I’ll   strength - en       thee,   help    thee,    and     cause   thee   to     stand,   Up   - held    by     My      right - eous,   om  - ni   - po  - tent   hand.    
verse      “When   through   fier - y      tri  - als     thy    path   - way    shall   lie,     My    grace,   all       suf  - fi    - cient,   shall   be       thy    sup  - ply:    The    flame      shall    not     hurt    thee;    I       on    - ly     de   - sign     Thy    dross   to     con   - sume,   and     thy   gold   to    re   - fine.    
verse      “When   through   the    deep   wa   - ters    I      call     thee   to      go,      The   riv    - ers       of     sor   - row      shall   not      o    - ver  - flow;   For    I          will     be      with    thee,    thy     trou  - bles   to     bless,   And    sanc  - ti   - fy      to      thee    thy   deep - est   dis  - tress.   
verse      “Ev’n   down      to     old    age    all     My     peo    - ple    shall   prove    My    sov    - ’reign,   e    - ter   - nal,     un    - change - a    - ble    love;   And    when       hoar   - y       hairs   shall    their   tem   - ples   a    - dorn,    Like   lambs   they   shall   still   in      My    bos  - om    be     borne.   
verse      “The    soul      that   on     Je   - sus     hath   leaned   for    re    - pose,    I     will     not,      I      will    not      de    - sert     to     its    foes;   That   soul,      though   all     hell    should   en    - deav  - or     to     shake,   I’ll   nev   - er,    no      nev   - er,     no    nev  - er    for  - sake.”
