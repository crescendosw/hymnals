verse      Once    more,   my     soul,    the   ris   - ing     day      Sa     - lutes    thy     wak   - ing    eyes;     Once   more,   my      voice,   thy     trib    - ute   pay       To    Him     that   rules   the     skies.   
verse      Night   un    - to     night    His   name    re    - peats;   The      day      re    - news    the    sound,    Wide   as      the     heav’n   on      which     He    sits      To    turn    the    sea   - sons    round.   
verse      ’Tis    He      sup  - ports    my    mor   - tal     frame,   My       tongue   shall   speak   His    praise;   My     sins    would   rouse    His     wrath     to    flame,    And   yet     His    wrath   de    - lays.    
verse      On      a       poor   worm     Thy   pow’r   might   tread,   And      I        could   ne’er   with - stand;    Thy    jus   - tice    might    have    crushed   me    dead,     But   mer   - cy     held    Thy     hand.    
verse      A       thou  - sand   wretch - ed    souls   are     fled     Since    the      last    set   - ting   sun,      And    yet     Thou    length - ’nest   out       my    thread,   And   yet     my     mo    - ments   run.     
verse      Dear    God,    let    all      my    hours   be      Thine,   Whilst   I        en    - joy     the    light.    Then   shall   my      sun      in      smiles    de  - cline,    And   bring   a      pleas - ant     night.
