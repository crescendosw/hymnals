verse      How    sweet   the   name      of      Je    - sus     sounds    In     a        be   - liev    - er’s   ear!       It     soothes   his   sor   - rows,   heals   his    wounds,   And    drives   a    - way      his   fear.    
verse      It     makes   the   wound   - ed      spir  - it      whole     And    calms    the    trou    - bled   breast;    ’Tis   man     - na    to      the     hun   - gry    soul      And    to       the    wear   - y,    rest.    
verse      Dear   name,   the   rock      on      which   I       build,    My     shield   and    hid     - ing    place,     My     nev     - er  - fail  - ing     treas - ’ry,   filled    With   bound  - less   stores   of    grace!   
verse      By     Thee    my    pray’rs   ac    - cep   - tance   gain,     Al   - though   with   sin       de   - filed;     Sa   - tan       ac  - cus   - es      me      in     vain,     And    I        am     owned    a     child.   
verse      Je   - sus!    my    Shep    - herd,   Hus   - band,   Friend,   My     Proph  - et,    Priest,   and    King,      My     Lord,     my    life,   my      way,    my     end,      Ac   - cept     the    praise   I     bring.   
verse      Weak   is      the   ef      - fort    of      my      heart,    And    cold     my     warm    - est    thought,   But    when      I     see     Thee    as      Thou   art,      I’ll   praise   Thee   as       I     ought.   
verse      Till   then    I     would     Thy     love    pro   - claim     With   ev     - ’ry    fleet   - ing    breath,    And    may       the   mu    - sic     of      Thy    name      Re   - fresh    my     soul     in    death.
