verse      I     to     the     hills    will   lift     mine   eyes;   From   whence   doth    come   mine   aid?     My      safe  - ty    com   - eth     from    the   LORD,    Who   heav’n   and    earth   hath   made.     
verse      Thy   foot   He’ll   not      let    slide,   nor    will    He     slum   - ber     that   thee   keeps.   Be    - hold,   He    that    keeps   Is    - ra  - el,      He    slum   - bers   not,    nor    sleeps.   
verse      The   LORD   thee    keeps,   the    LORD     thy    shade   On     thy      right   hand   doth   stay:    The     moon    by    night   thee    shall   not   smite,   Nor   yet      the    sun     by     day.      
verse      The   LORD   shall   keep     thy    soul;    He     shall   Pre  - serve    thee    from   all    ill.     Hence - forth   thy   go    - ing     out     and   in       God   keep     for    ev    - er     will.
