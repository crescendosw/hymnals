verse      A   - way    in    a      man - ger,   no    crib   for    a    bed,     The     lit - tle   Lord   Je - sus    laid   down   His   sweet   head.    The     stars   in      the    bright   sky    looked   down   where   He    lay,    The   lit  - tle   Lord   Je   - sus   a    - sleep   on     the    hay.     
verse      The   cat  - tle   are    low - ing,   the   Ba   - by     a  - wakes,   But     lit - tle   Lord   Je - sus,   no     cry  - ing   He      makes.   I       love    Thee,   Lord   Je     - sus!   Look     down   from    the   sky,    And   stay   by    my     cra  - dle   till   morn  - ing    is     nigh.    
verse      Be    near   me,   Lord   Je  - sus,   I     ask    Thee   to   stay     Close   by    me    for  - ev - er     and    love   me,   I       pray.    Bless   all     the     dear   chil   - dren   in       Thy    ten   - der   care,   And   take   us    to     Heav - en    to     live    with   Thee   there.
