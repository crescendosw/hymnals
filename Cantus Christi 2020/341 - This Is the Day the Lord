verse      Ho    - san - na    to      th’a - noint - ed    King,     To     Da     - vid’s   ho    - ly     Son!     Help   us,      O     Lord;      de  - scend   and      bring     Sal  - va     - tion   from    Thy    throne.   
verse      Blest   be    the   Lord,   who    comes   to    men       With   mes    - sag   - es      of     grace;   Who    comes    in    God        the   Fa    - ther’s   name      To     save     our    sin   - ful    race.
