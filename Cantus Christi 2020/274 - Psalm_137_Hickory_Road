verse      Be    - side    the   streams   of     Bab   - y      - lon,     We      shed   our   tears   of     grief.   When   we    re    - mem   - bered   Zi    - on    there,   Our    hearts   knew   no      re  - lief.      We    hung   our     harps   up    - on    the     trees;    Our   tongues   their   si  - lence   kept.    We    mourned   for   lost    Je  - ru   - sa - lem    And   with     the     wil   - lows    wept.    
verse      Those   cru   - el    men       who    con   - quered   us       And     took   us    from    our    home     Re   - qui - red     of      us      songs   of    mirth    In   - stead    of     sighs   and   groans.    But   how    could   we      sing    Yah - weh’s   songs     So    far       from    Zi  - on’s    land?    How   could     we    cheer - ful - ly     o  - bey    Our   cap    - tors’   cruel   com   - mand?    
verse      How     could   we    sing?     How    could   we       not!     We      dare   not   just    for  - get.     Je   - ru  - sa    - lem,    our     great - est   joy,     Must   be       our    great   joy   yet!       Can   e    - ven     our     cap   - tiv - i     - ty        Our   love      for     Zi  - on      kill?    If    I         do    not     ex  - ult    in   her,   May   my       hands   lose    their   skill.   
verse      So,     yes,    we    will      sing   Yah   - weh’s    songs;   We’ll   call   His   venge   ance   down     On     E   - dom’s   sons,   who     said    of    Zi     - on,    “Raze    it     to      the   ground,”   On    Ba   - bel’s   daugh   ters,   cru - el      wolves,   Who   rav     - aged    Yah - weh’s   flock.   Let   him       re  - joice   who   dash - es   you    A   - gainst   the     might - y       rock!
