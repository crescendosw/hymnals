verse      How     love  - ly,   LORD    of     hosts,     to    me          The    tab  - er    - nac     - les   of      Thy     grace!    Oh,     how     I       long,   yes,   faint      to     see      Je   - ho     - vah’s   courts,   His     dwell - ing      place!   My      heart   and     flesh    with   joy     draw    nigh      As     to        the     liv    - ing    God     I      cry.    
verse      The     spar  - row   has     her    place      of    rest;       The    swal - low,    through   Thy   kind  - ly      care,     Has     found   where   she     may    build      her    nest     And    brood    her     young     in      safe  - ty       there:   Thine   al    - tars,   where    they   rest    their   wings,    O      LORD      of      hosts,   my     God,    my     King.   
verse      Blest   they    who   in      Thy    house      a   - bide;       To     Thee   they    ev      - er    ren   - der     praise.   Blest   they    who     in      Thy    strength   con  - fide     And    in       whose   heart     are     pil   - grims’   ways.    They    make    the     vale     of     tears   a       spring,   With   show’rs   of      bless  - ings   cov   - er   - ing.    
verse      Ad    - vanc  - ing   still   from   strength   to    strength,   They   go     where   oth     - er    pil   - grims   trod      Till    each    to      Zi    - on     comes      at     length   And    stands   be    - fore      the     face    of       God.     LORD    God     of      hosts,   my     plead - ing     hear;     O      Ja      - cob’s   God,     to     me      give   ear.    
verse      Look    Thou,   O     God,    up   - on         our   Shield;     The    face   of      Thine     A   - noint - ed      see;      One     day     with  - in      Thy    courts     will   yield    More   good     than    thou    - sands   with  - out      Thee.    I’d     rath  - er      stand    near   my      God’s   house     Than   dwell     in      tents    of     wick  - ed   - ness.   
verse      For     God     the   LORD    is     shield     and   sun;        The    LORD   will    grace     and   glo   - ry      give.     No      good    will    He      with - hold       from   one      Who    does     up    - right   - ly      walk    and      live.    O       LORD    of      hosts,   how    blest   is      he        Who    plac    - es      all      his    trust   in     Thee!
