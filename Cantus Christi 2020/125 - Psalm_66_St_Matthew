verse      O      all      the   earth,   in     joy - ful    shouts,   To      God      your   voic - es     raise.   And     sing   the    glo     - ry     of    His   name,    And     glo   - rious   make     His    praise.   To   God     de  - clare,   “How   awe   - some   are      The   won   - drous   works   You    do!”   So    great   Your    strength!   Your   en    - e     - mies   In    haste   sub  - mit      to   You.    
verse      Yes,   all      the   earth    will   wor - ship   You,      They    praise   to     You    will   sing;    And     to     Your   name      most   glo - ri  - ous      Their   songs   of      praise   will   bring.    O    come,   be  - hold     the    works   of     God,     His   might - y       do    - ings   see;   In    won   - drous   works       on     man’s   be    - half   How   tru   - ly     great    is   He!     
verse      He     turned   the   sea      in   - to    dry    land,     Their   feet     a      path - way    had      Where   they   then   through   the    riv - er    walked   Let     us      in      Him      be     glad!     He   rules   for - ev     - er     by      His    might,   On    na    - tions   keeps   His    eye.   Let   not     the     proud,      re   - bel   - lious   ones   Ex  - alt     them - selves   on   high!   
verse      O       all   you   peo   - ples,   bless   our     God,     A    - broad    pro     - claim   His    praise;   The   One    who   keeps   our   souls     a   - live,    Our   feet    from   stum   - bling    stays.   For   You,   O      God,    have   test - ed     us       As      sil    - ver   is     re   - fined.     You   caught   us    in      a    net,    and    on     Our    backs    a      load     You    bind.     
verse      You     let   men   tram  - ple     on      our     heads;   We     passed   through   fire    and    flood.    But   then   at    last    you   brought   us    to       A     place   of     boun   - teous    good.    And   so     I’ll   come    in   - to     Your   house;   Burnt   of     - fer - ings   I’ll   pay        To    keep     the   vows    my   lips    had    made   When   trou   - bles   filled   my     way.      
verse      Burnt   of  - fer - ings    of      fat   - tened   beasts   With   smoke    of        rams    I’ll   take;     And   from   the   cat   - tle   and       the   goats    I     will    an     of     - f’ring   make.    All   you    that   fear    God,   come   and    hear     What    God      did   for    my     soul.      For   with     my    mouth   I    cried   to     Him,   My     tongue   did    Him      ex   - tol.      
verse      If      in    my    heart   I       cher  - ished   sin,     The    Lord     then      would   not    hear.     But   sure - ly    God     has   heard     my    voice,   He    to      my     pray’r   gave     ear.     For - ev   - er     bless - ed     be     our    God!     My      pray’r   He    has    not    spurned;   And   He       has   not     a  - way     from   me     His    lov    - ing  - kind   - ness   turned.
