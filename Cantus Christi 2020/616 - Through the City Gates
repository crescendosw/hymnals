verse      Through   the   cit  - y     gates    they   viewed   Thee,   Rid - ing   on     with   re     - gal      poise;   Thith - er      they    with   praise   pur - sued   Thee,   Wel   - comed   Thee    with    fren   - zied   joys.   Wild      they    waved    their   palms   of     glo  - ry,     Spread   their   cloaks   be   - fore    Thy   foal;    Ea   - ger   youth   and   bald - ing    hoar - y       Joined   in    ec   - sta - sy      of    soul.     
verse      Now       our   eyes   by    faith    be   - hold     Thee;   En  - ter   Thou   our    midst,   we       pray;    We      would   in      our    hearts   en  - fold   Thee.   We      would   claim   Thy     Heav’n - ly     sway.   Cleanse   these   courts   by      sin     in   - fest - ed;     Ban    - ish     hence    our    world - ly    care,    Till   of    earth   and   self   di   - vest - ed,     We       be  - come   Thy   house   of    pray’r.   
verse      We        our   high - est   praise   pre  - sent     Thee.   We    our   deep - est    rev    - ’rence   give.    May     no      stain   of     heart    pre - vent   Thee.   Lord,   with  - in      these   tem    - ples   live.   Dwell     with  - in       these   fi    - nite   mor  - tals,   Till     at      length   with   Thee    we    dwell,   Till   we    en    - ter   Heav - en’s   por  - tals,   Till     our   true   ho  - san   - nas   swell.
