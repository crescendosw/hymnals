verse      How    bright   these   glo    - rious   spir   - its    shine!   Whence    all    their    white    ar   - ray?    How   came    they    to       the     bliss  - ful    seats    Of    ev    - er   - last  - ing     day?    Lo!   these   are    they      from   suf   - f’rings   great,     Who     came    to      realms    of    light,   And    in       the    blood    of    Christ   have   washed   Those    robes   which    shine   so      bright.   
verse      Now,   with     tri   - um     - phal    palms,   they   stand    Be      - fore   the      throne   on     high    And   serve   the     God      they    love     a    - mid      The   glo   - ries   of      the     sky.    His   pres  - ence   fills     each   heart   with      joy,       Tunes   ev    - ’ry     mouth     to    sing,    By     day,     by     night,   the   sa     - cred   courts   With     glad    ho     - san   - nas     ring.     
verse      Hun  - ger      and     thirst   are     felt     no     more,    Nor       suns   with     scorch - ing    ray;    God   is      their   sun,     whose   cheer  - ing    beams    Dif - fuse    e    - ter   - nal     day.    The   Lamb    who    dwells    a    - mid     the       throne     Shall   o’er    them    still     pre - side,    Feed   them     with   nour   - ish - ment     di   - vine,    And      all     their    foot  - steps   guide.    
verse      At   - tend   - ing     an     - gels    shout    for    joy,     And       the    bright   ar     - mies   sing;   Mor - tals!   be    - hold     the     sa     - cred   seat     Of    your    de   - scend - ing     King!   The   God     of     glo     - ry     down    to        men        Re    - moves   His     blest     a   - bode;    He     dwells   with   men;     His   peo    - ple    they,    And      He      His      peo   - ple’s   God.      
verse      His    gra    - cious   hand     shall   wipe     the    tears    From      ev   - ’ry      weep   - ing    eye,    And   pains   and     groans   and     griefs   and    fears    And   death   it   - self    shall   die.    “Be   hold,   I      change    all    hu    - man       things!”   Saith   He,     whose   words     are   true;    “Lo!   what     was    old      is    passed   a    - way,     And      all     things   are     made    new!      
verse      “I     am       the     First;   I       am       the    Last,    Through   end  - less     years    the    same;   ‘I    AM’     is      My       me    - mor    - ial    still,   And   My      e    - ter   - nal     name.   Ho,   ye      that   thirst!   To     you     My        grace      Shall   hid   - den     streams   dis - close    And    o      - pen    full     the   sa     - cred   spring   Whence   life    for    - ev    - er      flows.”
