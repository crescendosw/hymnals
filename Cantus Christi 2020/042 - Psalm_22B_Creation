verse      To     all    my      bro    - thers   I’ll     de     - clare   The     glo  - ry     of        Your    ho     - ly    name.    I’ll   praise   You     where    the     peo   - ple     meet.   Who    fear    the     LORD,   His    praise   pro - claim;   All    sons     of    Ja    - cob,    praise   His    grace;    And    stand   in      awe,     all     Is    - rael’s   race.      
verse      For    He     has     not      de    - spised   the      poor;   He      has    not    scorned   their   wretch - ed    state.   He     has      not     turned   a     - way     His     face    From   an    - y     - one     in     trou   - ble   great.   When   an     - y     cried   to      Him      in     grief,    He     heard   his     pray’r   and     sent    re     - lief.      
verse      With - in     the     con    - gre   - ga     - tion     great   I       of   - fer    praise    You     have     sup - plied.   I’ll   pay      my      vows     with    those   who     fear;   The    meek    with    food    are    sat    - is  - fied.    Who    seek     the   LORD    shall   Him      a    - dore.     May    Your    heart   live     for   - ev    - er     - more.      
verse      All    ends   of      earth,   re    - mem    - b’ring   Him,    Shall   turn   them - selves    un    - to       the   LORD.    The    kin    - dreds   of       the     na    - tions   then    To     Him     their   hom   - age    shall    ac  - cord.    Be   - cause    the   LORD    the     king   - dom    owns      And    rules   a     - bove     all     earth - ly       thrones.   
verse      The    rich   and     might  - y       of       the      earth   Shall   eat    and    low       be    - fore     Him   bend,    And    in       His     pre    - sence   all     shall   bow     Who    help  - less    to      the    dust     de  - scend,   The    wretch - ed    who,    al    - though   they   strive,   Yet    can   - not     keep     their   souls   a      - live.      
verse      A      seed   shall   rise     to      serve    His      will,   And     to     the    age       it      shall    be    told     A    - bout     our     Lord;    then    they    shall   come    And    shall   His     right - eous - ness     un  - fold     Un   - to       a     peo   - ple     yet      un   - known,    That   this    was     done     by      Him     a      - lone.
