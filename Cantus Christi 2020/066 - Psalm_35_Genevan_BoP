verse      Strive,   LORD,   with    those   who     strive   with   me,      Fight   Thou     my     fight   and   set     me      free.    Take   shield   and   buck   - ler,   rise   in    splen - dor,   Stand   up     in     glo     - ry,      my     De  - fend  - er.     Draw     out     the     spear     and     bar    the     way     Of      those   who    want     me     for    their   prey;    Say    to     my    soul,   “Be      still   and   know,    I      shall   to     you       sal  - va       - tion     show.”    
verse      Let       them    be      put     to      scorn    and    shame    Who     seek     my     life    and   me      de    - fame.    Let    them     be    turned   back   and    con - found - ed     Who     har  - ass    me,       by       whom   I’m   hound - ed.     Foiled   be      the     mis     - chief   they   in    - tend.   Be      they    like   chaff    be   - fore   the     wind,    And    let    the   An    - gel      of      the   LORD     Pur  - sue     them   with      His    glit     - t’ring   sword.    
verse      Their     way     be      slip  - p’ry,   dark     with   woe,     The     An     - gel    of      the   LORD    their   foe.     A      net      to    snare    me     they   had   hid   - den.   Hadst   Thou   not,   LORD,     their    ruse   for - bid   - den,    They     would   have    caught    me      in     their   pit.    May     they    them - selves   fall   in   - to      it.      Let    ru   - in    seize   them     un    - a   - wares;   May    their   own    net       them - selves     en     - snare.    
verse      Then      shall   my      soul    in      God      re   - joice,   And     praise   Him    with    a     thank - ful     voice.   I      shall    de  - light    with   ex   - ul  - ta    - tion   In      His    de   - liv     - ’rance   and    sal - va    - tion.   My       bones   shall   say,      “Who    is     like    Thee,   O       LORD,   who    dost     de   - liv  - er      me,      With   all    the   weak    and      those   in    need,    From   our     op   - press   - or’s   strength   and      greed?”   
verse      Ma      - li    - cious   wit   - ness  - es       a    - rise;    They    ques   - tion   me      and   ut    - ter     lies.    With   e      - vil   they     for    good   re  - pay     me;    I       am     per  - plexed.   They     seek   to    slay    me.     Yet      I       was     grieved   when    they   were    sick;   Their   sor   - rows   hurt     me     to     the     quick.   I      went   in    sack  - cloth,   I       did   fast;    I      bowed   in     pray’r,   with   eyes       down   - cast.
