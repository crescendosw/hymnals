verse      Not      to       our     names,   Thou   on     - ly      just     and    true,     Not     to        our    worth - less   names    is      glo   - ry    due;     Thy     pow’r   and      grace,    Thy     truth    and     jus     - tice,   claim     Im     - mor   - tal   hon     - ors     to         Thy     sov    - ’reign   name:     Shine   through   the    earth    from    Heav’n,   Thy     blest   a     - bode,     Nor     let     the    hea   - thens   say,   “Where   is       your   God?”     
verse      Heav’n   is       Thy     high   - er     court,   there   stands   Thy    throne,   And     through   the    low   - er     worlds   Thy     will    is    done.    Our     God     framed   all       this    earth,   these   heav’ns   He      spread.   But      fools   a   - dore      the     gods       their   hands    have     made:     The     kneel   - ing    crowd,   with    looks     de    - vout,   be    - hold      Their   sil   - ver    sav   - iors,   and    their    saints   of     gold.     
verse      Vain     are      those   art    - ful    shapes   of      eyes     and    ears;     The     mol     - ten    im    - age    nei    - ther    sees    nor   hears;   Their   hands   are      help    - less,   nor      their   feet      can     move,     They     have    no    speech,   nor     thought,   nor     pow’r,   nor      love;     Yet     fool    - ish    mor    - tals    make      their   long    com   - plaints   To      their   deaf   i     - dols    and    un     - mov    - ing    saints.   
verse      The      rich     have    stat   - ues    well     a     - dorned   with   gold;     The     poor,     con  - tent    with   gods     of      coars - er    mould,   With    tools   of       i       - ron     carve    the     sense   - less    stock,    Lopped   from    a     tree,     or      bro      - ken     from     a        rock;     Peo   - ple       and    priest   drive   on        the     sol   - emn     trade,    And     trust   the    gods    that    saws   and      ham    - mers   made.     
verse      Be       heav’n   and     earth    a    - mazed!   ’Tis    hard     to     say       Which   is        more   stu   - pid:   their    false   gods    or    they.    O       Is    - rael,    trust     the     Lord;    He      hears     and     sees,     He       knows   thy   sor     - rows    and        re    - stores   thy      peace;    His     wor     - ship   does     a       thou    - sand    com   - forts   yield,    He      is      thy    help;   He      is     thy      Heav’n - ly     shield.   
verse      In       God      we      trust;   our    im     - pious   foes     in     vain      At    - tempt     our    ru    - in,    and      op    - pose    His   reign;   Had     they    pre    - vailed,   dark  - ness     had     closed    our     days,     And      death   and   si      - lence   had        for   - bade     His      praise.   But     we        are    saved,   and     live—     let     songs   a     - rise      And     Zi    - on     bless   the     God    that     built    the    skies.
