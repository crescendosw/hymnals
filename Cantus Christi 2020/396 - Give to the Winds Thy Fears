verse      Give      to       the    winds    thy    fears,     Hope    and       be    un     - dis - mayed.   God    hears    thy    sighs    and    counts   thy    tears,    God    shall   lift   up     thy      head.     
verse      Through   waves    and    clouds   and    storms,    He      gen     - tly   clears   thy   way;     Wait   thou     His    time;    so     shall    this   night     Soon   end     in     joy  - ous      day.      
verse      Still     heav   - y      is       thy    heart?     Still   sinks     thy   spir   - it    down?    Cast   off      the    world,   let    fear     de   - part      Bid    ev    - ’ry    care   be     - gone.     
verse      What      though   Thou   rul    - est    not;       Yet     Heav’n,   and   earth,   and   Hell     Pro  - claim,   “God   sit    - teth   on       the    throne,   And    rul   - eth    all    things   well.”    
verse      And       what   - so   - e’er     Thou   will’st,   Thou    dost,     O     King     of    kings;   What   Thine    un   - err    - ing    wis    - dom    chose,    Thy    pow’r   to     be   - ing      brings.   
verse      Leave   to      His   sov   - ’reign   sway       To    choose   and    to      com - mand;    So     shalt   thou,   won  - d’ring,   own    that   way,       How    wise,    how   strong   this   hand.   
verse      Far,    far     a   - bove    thy      thought,   His   coun   - sel    shall   ap  - pear,    When   ful   - ly      He     the       work   hath   wrought,   That   caused   thy   need   - less   fear.   
verse      Thou    seest   our   weak  - ness,    Lord;      Our   hearts   are    known   to    Thee;    O      lift    Thou    up     the       sink - ing    hand,      Con  - firm     the   fee    - ble    knee!   
verse      Let     us      in    life,   in       death,     Thy   stead  - fast   truth   de  - clare,   And    pub   - lish    with   our       lat  - est    breath     Thy    love     and   guard  - ian    care.
