verse      I         cry    out,    that    God       may    hear    me      And    with   help   be     ev    - er     near    me.     To      the   LORD     I       cry    a   - loud      By     a      weight   of       trou    - bles   bowed.      I         stretch   out     my     hand       to      reach   Him.    Day      and     night   my     pray’rs   be  - seech   Him;     To     my       God     my     grief    I       told;     I     re    - fuse    to    be      con    - soled.    
verse      I         re   - mem   - ber     God       with   weep  - ing.    He     has    kept   my     eyes    from   sleep - ing.    And     my    spir   - it      is     so    weak      That   I’m    too      dis    - traught   to     speak.      Through   the       night   my     thoughts   in      sad   - ness    Turn     to      for   - mer    days      of    glad  - ness,    To     my       songs   of     years    gone    by,       And   I       in      my    sor   - row      sigh:     
verse      “Will     the    LORD    spurn   us        for  - ev    - er      And    with - hold   from   us      His    fa    - vor?    Will    His   love     and     mer  - cy    fail?     Will   His    prom   - ise      not       pre  - vail?       Will      He        not     for  - give       trans - gres  - sion    But,     for   - get   - ting   His       com - pas   - sion,    Let    His      burn  - ing    wrath    re    - place     His   un    - fail  - ing   love    and      grace?”   
verse      Then      I      said,   “This   is        what   hurts   me:     That   the    Most   High   God     de   - serts   me,     That    I     am       from    Him    es  - tranged   Now    that   His      right    hand      has    changed.”   Yet       I         will    re   - call       and     pon   - der     All      His     awe     some   works     of    won   - der,     Med  - i      - tat   - ing    with     de    - light     On    His     deeds   so    great   in       might.    
verse      All       Your   ways,   O       strong    De   - fend  - er,     Are    most   ho   - ly,    great   in     splen - dor.    What    god   is       there   an   - y   - where     Who    can    with     our      God       com  - pare?       You       worked    won   - ders   of         sal   - va    - tion,   Showed   Your    pow’r   a    - mong      the   na    - tions.   Your   strong   arm     re   - deemed   and     freed     Ja  - cob’s   sons    and   Jo    - seph’s   seed.     
verse      Might   - y      wa    - ters    writhed   and    trem  - bled,   For    they   saw    You    and     were   hum   - bled;   Fear    con - vulsed   the     hid  - den   deep,     Made   the    roar   - ing      bil     - lows   leap.       Clouds    poured    rain,   with   thun     - der     crash - ing,    And      Your    ar    - rows   kept      on    flash - ing.     With   the      light - ning   bolts    You     hurled,   You   lit     up      and   shook   the      world.    
verse      Through   the    sea,    where   waves     were   toss    ing,    You    laid   bare   a      path    for    cross - ing.    Might - y     wa     - ters    fled   in    awe,      Yet    Your   foot   - prints   no        man    saw.
