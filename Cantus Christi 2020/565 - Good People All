verse      The     night   be    - fore    that   hap    - py      tide    The     no     - ble     vir    - gin   and    her     guide    Were   long   time    seek  - ing    up       and    down     To        find   a      lodg   - us   ing     in       the     town.    But    mark    right     well   what   came   to     pass:   From   ev     - ’ry    door   re       - pelled,   a    - las!

With - in      a         man  - ger    He     was    laid,   And    by       His    side   the        vir     - gin    maid     At  - tend  - ing      to      the     Lord       of     Life,    Who     came     on    earth   ed   to      end   all     strife.
