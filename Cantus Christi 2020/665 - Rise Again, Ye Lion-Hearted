Whith  - er    is      your   strength   de   - par  - ted,   Whith - er     gone    your   mar - tyr  - dom?    Lo,   love’s   light   is     on     them,   Glo   - ry’s   flame    up   - on     them,   And     their   will   to     die    doth    quell   Ev’n   the    lord       and     prince   of     Hell.

Mid   the      roar    and    rat  - tle     Of      tu   - mult   - uous   bat  - tle     In      de    - sire   they   soar   a     - bove    All    that   earth      would   have     them   love.   
verse      Great   of    heart,   they   know   no      turn  - ing,   Hon    - or,   gold,   they    laugh    to     scorn,   Quench   de  - sires   with - in         them   burn - ing,   By      no     earth - ly     pas - sion   torn.   Mid   the      li    - ons’   roar - ing,    Songs   of     praise   out  - pour - ing,    Joy   - ous   - ly     they   take   their   stand   On     th’a - re       - na’s    blood  - y      sand.
