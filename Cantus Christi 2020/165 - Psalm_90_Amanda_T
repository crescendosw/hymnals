verse      Through   ev    - ’ry    age,      e   - ter   - nal   God,    Thou     art    our   rest,   our     safe    a  - bode;    High   was     Thy   throne   ere      heav’n   was   made,    Or     earth   Thy    hum   - ble     foot - stool   laid.    Death,   like   an    o     - ver - flow  - ing   stream,   Sweeps   us      a   - way;     our   life’s   a     dream,   An     emp   - ty     tale,   a     morn - ing   flow’r,   Cut   down   and    with  - ered   in        an     hour.   
verse      Long      hadst   Thou   reigned   ere   time    be  - gan,    Or       dust   was   fash  - ioned   in    - to   man;     And    long    Thy   king   - dom      shall    en  - dure     When   earth   and    time    shall   be     no      more.    Our      age    to    seven - ty    years   is    set;      How      short   the   time!    how   frail    the   state!   And    if      to     eight - y     we     ar  - rive,     We    ra   - ther   sigh    and    groan     than   live.   
verse      But       man,    weak   man,      is    born    to    die,    Made     up     of    guilt   and     van   - i  - ty;      Thy    dread - ful   sen    - tence,   LORD,    was   just,    “Re  - turn,   ye     sin   - ners,   to     your    dust.”   But      oh,    how   oft     Thy   wrath   ap  - pears,    And      cuts    off   our      ex  - pect   - ed    years!   Thy    wrath   a    - wakes   our   hum  - ble   dread;    We    fear   the    pow’r   that   strikes   us     dead.   
verse      A         thou  - sand   of        our   years   a   - mount   Scarce   to     a     day     in      Thine   ac - count;   Like   yes   - ter - day’s    de     - part   - ed    light,   Or     the     last   watch   of      end  - ing     night.   Teach    us,    O     LORD,   how   frail   is    man;      And      kind  - ly    length - en    out      our   span,    Till   a       wise   care    of    pi   - e   - ty        Fit   us     to     die,    and    dwell     with   Thee.
