verse      O     Thou     in       whose   pres   - ence    my     soul    takes   de   - light,    On    whom   in       af  - flict - tion    I     call,    My      Com     - fort   by      day,     and    my      Song    in      the    night,   My      Hope,   my       Sal  - va    - tion,   my     All.     Where   dost     Thou,   dear   Shep   - herd,   re   - sort     with   Thy     sheep,    To     feed      them   in      pas   - tures   of    love,     Say,   why       in     the      val      - ley    of    death    should   I       weep,    Or    lone    in      the   wil    - der  - ness    rove?    
verse      Oh,   why      should   I       wan    - der     an     al    - ien     from   Thee,     Or    cry    in       the   des   - ert     for   bread?   Thy     foes      will   re    - joice,   when   my      sor   - rows    they   see,     And     smile   at       the    tears   I       have   shed.    Ye      daugh  - ters    of     Zi     - on,     de   - clare,   have   ye      seen      The    Star      that   on      Is    - ra    - el    shone?    Say,   if        in     your     tents      my     Be  - lov    - ed       has     been,    And   where   with    His   flocks   He     is      gone?    
verse      His   vest   - ments    of      right  - eous  - ness   who     shall   de   - scribe!   Its   pur  - i      - ty    words   would   de  - file;    The     heav’ns   from   His     pres   - ence   fresh   beaut - ies     im   - bibe,    And     earth   is       made   rich    by      His    smile.   Such    is       my      Be   - lov    - ed      in     ex     - cel  - lence   bright,   When   pleased   He     looks   down    from    a   - bove;     As     morn,     when   He       breathes   from   the   cham   - ber      of      light,   And   com   - forts   His   peo    - ple    with    love.    
verse      But   when     armed    with    venge  - ance,   in     ter   - ror     He     comes,    The   na   - tions’   re  - bel   - lions   to    tame,    The     reins     of     om    - ni     - po   - tent    pow’r   He      as   - sumes,   And     rides   in       a      char  - iot     of     flame.   The     thou   - sand    de   - struc  - tions   that   wait     for    His     word      And    ride      on     the     wings   of      His   breath,   Fly    swift     as     the      winds      at     the   nod      of       their   Lord,    And   deal    out     His   ar     - rows   of      death.   
verse      The   por    - tals     of      Heav’n   at      His    bid   - ding    o    - bey,      And   rise   ere      His   ban   - ners    ap  - pear;    Earth   trem    - bles   be    - neath,   till   her     moun  - tains   give   way,     And     Hell    shakes   her    fet   - ters    with   fear.    He      treads   on      the    clouds   as      the    dust     of     His     feet,     And    gath    - ers    the     storm   in      His   hand;     What   eye       the    fierce   glance     of     His   an     - ger      shall   meet,    Or    who     in      His   pres   - ence   shall   stand?   
verse      Re  - store,   might  - y       Sav    - ior,    The    light   of      Thy    face,     Thy   soul - cheer  - ing   com   - fort    im  - part.    And     let       the    sweet   to     - kens   of      par   - don   - ing    grace    Bring   joy     to       my     de    - sol   - ate    heart.   He      looks,   and     ten    thou   - sands   of     an     - gels   re    - joice,    And    my      - ri   - ads     wait    for     His   word,     He     speaks,   and    e      - ter      - ni   - ty,   filled   with     His     voice,   Re  - ech   - oes     the   praise   of     the     Lord.
