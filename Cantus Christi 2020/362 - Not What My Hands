verse      Not   what     my    hands    have   done      Can   save    my     guilt  - y     soul;    Not   what    my   toil  - ing      flesh   has   borne    Can   make   my     spir  - it     whole.   Not    what    I     feel   or     do       Can   give    me   peace   with   God;     Not    all        my    pray’rs   and     sighs   and     tears   Can    bear   my       aw    - ful   load.      
verse      Thy   voice    a   - lone,    O      Lord,     Can   speak   to     me       of    grace;   Thy   pow’r   a  - lone,   O        Son     of    God,     Can   all    my     sin     e    - rase.    No     oth   - er    work   but    Thine,   No    oth   - er   blood   will   do;      No     strength   but   that      which   is      di    - vine    Can    bear   me       safe  - ly    through.   
verse      Thy   work     a   - lone,    O      Christ,   Can   ease    this   weight   of    sin;     Thy   blood   a  - lone,   O        Lamb    of    God,     Can   give   me     peace   with - in.      Thy    love    to    me,    O      God,     Not   mine,   O    Lord,   to     Thee,    Can    rid        me    of        this    dark    un    - rest,   And    set    my       spir  - it    free.      
verse      I     bless    the   Christ   of     God;      I     rest    on     love     di  - vine;    And   with    un - fal   - t’ring   lip     and   heart,   I     call   this   Sav   - ior    mine.    His    cross   dis - pels   each   doubt;   I     bur   - y    in      His    tomb     Each   thought    of    un      - be    - lief    and     fear,   Each   lin  - g’ring   shade   of    gloom.     
verse      I     praise   the   God      of     grace;    I     trust   His    truth    and   might;   He    calls   me   His,    I        call    Him   mine,    My    God,   my     joy     and    light.   ’Tis   He      who   sav  - eth    me,      And   free  - ly   par   - don    gives;   I      love       be  - cause     He      first   loved   me,     I      live   be     - cause   He    lives.
