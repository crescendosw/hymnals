verse      The    LORD’s   my    shep - herd;   I’ll      not      want.   He      makes   me     down   to     lie     In     pas  - tures   green;   He     lead  - eth    me       The    qui   - et    wa    - ters     by.      
verse      My     soul     He    doth   re    - store     a      - gain,   And     me      to     walk   doth   make    With   in     the     paths    of     right - eous - ness,    Ev’n   for     His   own     name’s   sake.    
verse      Yea,   though   I     walk   in      death’s   dark     vale,   Yet     will    I      fear   no     ill,    For    Thou   art     with     me;    and     Thy    rod      And    staff   me    com   - fort     still.   
verse      My     ta     - ble   Thou   hast    fur     - nished   me      In      pres  - ence   of     my     foes;   My     head   Thou    dost     with   oil     a    - noint,   And    my      cup   o     - ver    - flows.   
verse      Good - ness     and   mer  - cy      all       my       life    Shall   sure  - ly     fol  - low    me;     And    in     God’s   house    for  - ev    - er   - more     My     dwell - ing   place   shall    be.
