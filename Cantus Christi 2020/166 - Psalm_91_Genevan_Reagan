verse      The      man      who    once     has     found   a   - bode,   With  - in      the     se    - cret    place   of      God      Shall   with   Al  - might     - y       God     a    - bide,    And    in        His    shad    - ow      safe  - ly        hide.    I      of      the     LORD     my       God     will    say,    “He    is     my      ref  - uge     and    my      stay;    To     Him     for     safe  - ty      I         will    flee,    In     Him    my    con   - stant   trust    shall   be.”     
verse      The      Lord     with   His      pro   - tect  - ing   care    Shall   keep    thee    from    the     hid   - den     snare;   When    fear - ful   plagues     a     - round   pre  - vail     Thy    life      the    scourge   shall   not     as      - sail.    Thou   shalt   be    - neath    His      wings   a     - bide,   And    safe   with  - in     His     care   con   - fide;    His    faith - ful   - ness    shall   ev      - er      be       A      sure   pro - tec   - tion    un     - to      thee.    
verse      No       night  - ly     ter    - rors    shall   a   - larm,   No      dead  - ly      shaft   by      day     shall   harm;    Nor     pes  - ti  - lence       that    walks   by     night,   Nor    plagues   that   waste     in      noon  - day       light.   At     thy     right   hand,    though   thou  - sands   die,    No     harm   shall   un   - to      thee   come    nigh;    But    thou    se    - cure,   un    - harmed,   shalt   see      What   wick - ed    men’s   re    - ward     shall   be.      
verse      Be     - cause    thy    trust    is      God     a   - lone,   Thy     ref   - uge     is      the     High  - est     One,     No      e    - vil   shall       up    - on      thee   come,    Nor    plague    ap   - proach    thy     guard - ed        home.    An   - gel   - ic      guards   at       His     com   - mands   Will   bear   thee    safe - ly      in     their   hands,   Will   keep    thee,   lest,   if      left      a     - lone,    Thou   dash   thy   foot    a     - gainst   a       stone.   
verse      Though   fierce   and    treach - ’rous   foes    as  - sail,   Their   pow’r   and     wrath   shall   not     pre   - vail;    Their   cru  - el    strength,   their   ven   - omed   spite,   Thou   shalt     o’er - come      with    con   - qu’ring   might.   Be   - cause   on      Me       he       set     his     love,   I      will   his     con  - stant   Sav  - ior     prove,   And    since   to      him     My      name      in      known,   I      will   ex  - alt     him     as       My      own.     
verse      As       oft      as     he       shall   call    on    Me,     Most    gra   - cious   shall   My      an    - swer    be;      I       will   be    with        him     in      dis  - tress,   And    in        his    trou    - ble     I       will      bless.   Com  - plete   de    - liv    - ’rance   I       will    give,   And    hon  - or      him    while   he     shall   live;    A    - bun   - dant    life    I       will      be    - stow,    To     him    My    full    sal   - va     - tion    show.
