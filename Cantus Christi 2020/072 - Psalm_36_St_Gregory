verse      My      heart   pro - claims     the     one    who    sins:     No        fear    of      God     comes   to      his     eyes.      Re    - joic  - ing     at      the       hate    with  - in,      His    words    are     wick   - ed    - ness    and   lies.     
verse      He      is      no    long     - er      good   or     wise.     In        bed     he      hatch - es      wick  - ed      plans;     He’s    set   - tled    on      the       path    of      lies;    He’s   not      re    - pelled   by      e     - vil   stands.   
verse      High    in      the   heav’ns,   e     - ter  - nal    God!      Thy       good  - ness    in      full    glo   - ry      shines,    Thy     truth   shall   break   through   ev    - ’ry     cloud    That   veils    and     dark   - ens     Thy     de  - signs.    
verse      For     ev    - er    firm       Thy     jus  - tice   stands,   As        moun  - tains   their   foun  - da    - tions   keep;      Wise    are     the     won   - ders      of      Thy     hands;   Thy    judg   - ments   are      a       might - y     deep.     
verse      My      God!    how   ex       - cel   - lent   Thy    grace,    Whence    all     our     hope    and     com   - fort    springs!   The     sons    of      Ad    - am        in      dis   - tress    Fly    to       the     shad   - ow      of      Thy   wings.    
verse      From    the     pro - vi       - sions   of     Thy    house     We        shall   be      fed     with    sweet   re    - past;      There   mer   - cy      like    a         riv   - er      flows,   And    brings   sal   - va     - tion    to      our   taste.    
verse      Life,   like    a     foun     - tain    rich   and    free,     Springs   from    the     pres  - ence    of      the     Lord;      And     in      Thy     light   our       souls   shall   see      The    glo    - ries    pro    - mised   in      Thy   Word.
