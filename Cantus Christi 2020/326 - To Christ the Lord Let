verse      To      Christ   the   Lord      let    ev   - ’ry   tongue    Its    nobl   - est   trib - ute   bring;   When   He’s   the    sub  - ject    of        the    song,      Who     can    re    - fuse     to     sing?    
verse      Ma    - jes    - tic   sweet   - ness   sits   en  - throned   Up   - on       His   aw   - ful   brow;    His    head   with   ra   - diant   glo     - ries   crowned;   His     lips   with    praise   o’er - flow.    
verse      No      mor    - tal   can       with   Him    com - pare;     A    - mong     the   sons   of    men;     Fair - er     He     is     than    all       the    fair       That    fill   the     Heav’n - ly     train.   
verse      He      saw      me    plunged   in     deep   dis - tress,    He     flew     to    my     re  - lief;    For    me     He     bore   the     shame   - ful    cross,     And     car  - ried    all      my     grief.   
verse      Since   from     His   boun    - ty     I      re  - ceive     Such   proofs   of    love   di  - vine,    Had    I      a      thou - sand    tongues   to     give,      Lord,   they   would   all      be     Thine.
