verse      O      God   of     earth   and   al    - tar,   Bow    down     and   hear     our   cry.      Our    earth - ly    rul   - ers   fal    - ter;   Our     peo - ple    drift   and   die.   The    walls   of    gold   en - tomb   us;     The   swords   of     scorn   di  - vide.    Take   not      Thy   thun - der   from   us,     But   take   a   - way     our    pride.   
verse      From   all   that   ter   - ror   teach - es,    From   lies     of    tongue   and   pen,      From   all     the   eas   - y     speech - es     That    com - fort   cru   - el    men,   From   sale    and   prof - a  - na   - tion    Of    hon    - or     and     the   sword,   From   sleep,   and   from   dam - na   - tion,   De  - liv  - er    us,     good   Lord!    
verse      Tie    in    a      liv   - ing   teth  - er     The    prince   and   priest   and   thrall.   Bind   all     our   lives   to  - geth   - er;    Smite   us    and    save    us    all.   In     ire     and   ex   - ul - ta   - tion,   A   - flame    with   faith   and   free,    Lift   up       a     liv  - ing   na   - tion,   A     sin  - gle   sword   to     Thee.
