verse      Blest   be      the     tie    that     binds    Our   hearts   in     Christ - ian    love;      The     fel    - low   - ship     of     kin    - dred   minds    Is        like    to      that   a   - bove.    
verse      Be    - fore    our     Fa   - ther’s   throne   We    pour     our    ar     - dent   pray’rs;   Our     fears,   our     hopes,   our    aims,    are    one,     Our       com   - forts   and    our   cares.   
verse      We      share   our     mu   - tual     woes,    Our   mu     - tual   bur    - dens   bear,      And     oft    - en      for      each   oth    - er     flows    The       sym   - pa    - thiz - ing   tear.    
verse      When    we      a     - sun  - der      part,    It    gives    us     in     - ward   pain;      But     we       shall   still    be     joined   in     heart,   And       hope    to      meet   a   - gain.    
verse      This    glo   - rious   hope   re     - vives    Our   cour   - age    by       the    way,       While   each     in      ex     - pec  - ta     - tion   lives,   And       longs   to      see    the   day.     
verse      From    sor   - row,    toil   and      pain,    And   sin,     we     shall    be     free;      And     per    - fect    love     and    friend - ship   reign    Through   all     e     - tern - i   - ty.
