verse      Thy    hand,   O       God,      hast   guid  - ed      Thy     flock    from     age     to     age;     The     wond  - rous    tale    is    writ - ten,     Full   clear,   on     ev    - ’ry      page;    Our   fa    - thers   owned   Thy     good  - ness,   And    we     their   deeds   re  - cord;     And   both   of      this    bear    wit    - ness,   One   church,   one   faith,   one   Lord.   
verse      Thy    her   - alds    brought   glad   tid   - ings,   To      great  - est,     as      to     least;   They    bade    men     rise,   and   has  - ten      To     share    the    great   King’s   feast;   And   this    was     all     their   teach - ing,    In     ev   - ’ry     deed    and   word,     To    all    a     - like    pro     claim  - ing,    One   church,   one   faith,   one   Lord.   
verse      When   shad  - ows     thick     were   fall  - ing,    And     all      seemed   sunk    in     night,   Thou,   Lord,   didst   send    Thy   ser  - vants,   Thy    cho    - sen    sons    of       light.   On    them    and     on      Thy     peo   - ple     Thy    plen - teous   grace   was   poured,   And   this   was     still   their   mes    - sage:   One   church,   one   faith,   one   Lord.   
verse      And    we,     shall   we        be     faith - less?   Shall   hearts   fail,    hands   hang   down?    Shall   we      e     - vade    the   con  - flict,   And    cast     a    - way     our      crown?   Not   so:     in      God’s   deep    coun  - sels    Some   bet  - ter     thing   is    stored:   We    will   main  - tain,   un      flinch - ing,    One   church,   one   faith,   one   Lord.   
verse      Thy    mer   - cy      will      not    fail    us      Nor     leave    Thy      work    un   - done;    With    Thy     right   hand    to    help   us       The    vic    - t’ry   shall   be       won;     And   then,   by      men     and     an    - gels,   Thy    name   shall   be      a   - dored,    And   this   shall   be      their   an     - them,   One   church,   one   faith,   one   Lord.
