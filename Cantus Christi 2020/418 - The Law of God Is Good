verse      To     those   who   help    in      Christ   have   found   And   would   in      works   of    love    a   - bound    It      shows   what   deeds   are     His     de   - light     And     should   be      done    as        good    and     right.    
verse      When   men     the   of    - fered   help     dis  - dain    And   wil   - ful   - ly      in    sin     re  - main,    Its     ter   - ror    in      their   ear     re   - sounds    And     keeps    their   wick  - ed      - ness    in      bounds.   
verse      The    law     is    good;   but     since    the    Fall    Its   ho    - li    - ness    con - demns   us    all;     It      dooms   us     for     our     sin     to     die       And     has      no      pow’r   to        jus   - ti    - fy.
