verse      By    false   wit  - ness - es      con  - vict  - ed     That   a   - gainst   me   were    sub   - orned,   I     was    pun     - ished   and      af - flict  - ed     For     the   ver  - y      things   I     scorned.   For    good   of     - fic   - es,   un   - grate - ful,   They   could   e      - vil   things   re  - turn,     In      de    - spite   of     kind   - ness,   hate - ful     To      my   sor    - r’wing   soul’s   con - cern.    
verse      Yet   when    they   were   sick    and    ail   - ing,   I      was   clad     in   weeds   of      woe;     But   my     ser     - vice    un     - a  - vail   - ing,   Shall   in  - to     my     bos    - om    flow.      I      be   - haved    as      for   a      broth - er,    Or     a       dear     fa  - mil    - iar   friend,   Paced   a     - bout    as     though   my      moth - er      Were    ap - proach - ing      to       her   end.     
verse      But   in      my     dis  - tress   they   jest  - ed,    Yea,   the   ver    - y    ab    - jects   met,     Mak - ing    mouths,   my      peace    in - fest   - ed     With  - out   ceas - ing    or       re  - gret.      Fawn - ing    glut   - tons,   in    con  - junc  - tion   With   the     mim    - ick - ing      buf - foon,     Gnash   their   teeth   with - out      com   - punc - tion,   And     my   mis    - ’ries    im     - por - tune.    
verse      How   long    will   my     Sa    - vior   leave   me     To     the   mer    - cy   of      such    men;     Oh,   from   li      - ons     fierce   re - prieve   me,    Pluck   my    soul   from   out      the   den.       So     with   thanks   Thy     God   head   greet - ing,   In     Thy     church   I     will     a   - dore;     And     fre   - quent   the    gen    - ’ral    meet - ing,    There   my   prais  - es       to       re  - store.
