verse      LORD,   Thou    hast   searched   me,    and    dost   know    Wher   e’er    I      rest,   wher - e’er    I      go;     Thou   know    - est     all     that    I       have   planned,   And   all       my     ways     are   in      Thy    hand.     All      that        I    am     I      owe     to    Thee,      Thy     wis - dom,    Lord,   has    fash    - ioned   me;       I      give    my    Mak    - er    thank - ful    praise,   Whose   won      drous   works   my   soul    a    - maze.   
verse      My      words   from   Thee       I      can  - not    hide,   I      feel    Thy    pow’r   on     ev    - ’ry    side;   Oh,    won       drous   knowl   edge,   aw    - ful    might,     Un  - fath    - omed   depth,   un  - meas  - ured   height!   Ere      in        - to   be   - ing    I       was   brought,   Thine   eye   did     see,    and    in        Thy     thought   My     life    in    all      its   per   - fect   plan      Was     or     - dered   ere     my   days    be   - gan.    
verse      Where   can     I      go         a    - part   from   Thee,   Or     whith - er     from    Thy    pres  - ence   flee?   In     heav’n?   It      is      Thy     dwell - ing    fair;      In    death’s   a    - bode?    Lo,   Thou    art    there.    Thy      thoughts,   O    God,   how    man   - i   - fold,      More    pre - cious   un    - to     me        than    gold!     I      muse    on    their    in  - fin   - i    - ty;       A     - wak    - ing     I       am   still   with   Thee.   
verse      If      I       the    wings      of     morn - ing    take,   And    far     a    - way     my     dwell - ing    make,   The    hand      that    lead  - eth     me      is     Thine,     And   my        sup  - port     Thy   pow’r   di   - vine.     The      wick      - ed   Thou   wilt   sure  - ly    slay,      From    me    let     sin   - ners   turn      a     - way;      They   speak   a   - gainst   the   name    di   - vine;     I       count    God’s   en    - e  - mies    as     mine.   
verse      If      deep  - est    dark     - ness   cov  - er     me,     The    dark    ness   hid   - eth    not     from   Thee;   To     Thee      both    night   and     day     are    bright;    The   dark    - ness   shin   - eth   as      the    light.    Search   me,         O    God,   my     heart   dis - cern,      Try     me,   my      in    - most   thought   to      learn;    And    lead    me,   if       in    sin     I      stray,    To      choose   the     ev    - er - last  - ing    way.
