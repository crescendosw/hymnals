verse      O         LORD,   You   are    the   God    who    saves;   I      cry     to      You    by      night   and   day.     Let    my     pe   - ti        - tion   rise    to   You;    In     - cline   Your   ear     to    me,    I      pray.    My    eye    grows   dim     be   - cause   of    grief,   My     hands    ex   - ten    - ded     up      to    You.     Will   You    work    won   - ders    for     the   dead?   Do     spir  - its    rise     and     give   You     praise?   
verse      My        soul    is    full   of    anx  - ious   cares.   My     life    draws   near - er      to      the   grave.   I      have   no     strength.   I’m    count - ed   with    Those    who     go     down    in  - to     the    pit.     Is    Your   great   love    told   in      the   grave—   Your   faith  - ful  - ness     in      the     a   - byss?    Are    Your   great   works   known   in      the   dark?   Your   right   eous   ness     where   mem  - ’ries   fade?     
verse      I         am      set   free   a   - mong   the    dead     Like   slain   who     lie    down    in      the   grave.   You    will   re   - mem       - ber    them    no   more,   For      they    are    cut     off   by     Your   hand.    But   I      cry     out     to     You,    O     LORD;    My     pray’r   con  - fronts   You     with    the   dawn.    Why    do     You     cast    my      soul    a   - way?    Why    do      You    hide     Your    face   from    me?       
verse      You       put     me    in     the   low  - est    pit,     In     dark  - est     re   - gions   of      the   deep.    Your   an   - ger    press     - es     heav  - i  - ly,     You      o     - ver  - whelm   me    with   Your   waves.   I     am     af    - flict - ed,    close   to    death;   I’ve   borne    Your   ter    - rors    since   my    youth.   Your   an   - ger     pass  - es      o     - ver   me;     Your   dread   as   - saults   have    cut    me      off.      
verse      Friends   watch   in    hor  - ror   from   a    - far;     You    made    me      o    - di    - ous     to    them.    I      am     shut   up          with - out     es - cape    Though   dai   - ly,    LORD,   I     call   to     You.     All   day    Your    ter   - rors   round   me    surge,   And    like     a      flood    close   in      on    me.      You    e    - ven     make    my      loved   one   flee;   The    dark  - ness   is       my      on   - ly      friend.
