verse      As   they   of     - fered   gifts   most   rare      At     that   cra  - dle   rude   and   bare,    So      may    we       with   ho     - ly    joy,     Pure,   and    free     from    sin’s   al  - loy,      All     our    cost - liest   treas - ures   bring,   Christ,   to   Thee,    our   Heav’n - ly    King.   
verse      Ho - ly     Je     - sus,    ev    - ’ry    day       Keep   us     in     the   nar  - row   way;     And,    when   earth  - ly     things   are   past,    Bring   our    ran    - somed   souls   at    last      Where   they   need   no      star    to     guide,   Where     no   clouds   Thy   glo    - ry    hide.
