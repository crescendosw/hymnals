verse      My      soul,   now   bless   thy   Mak   - er!    Let   all    with   - in       me     bless   His     name    Who   mak  - eth    thee       par  - tak  - er      Of    mer    - cies   more   than   thou    dar’st   claim.   For - get      Him   not     whose   meek  - ness   Still   bears   with   all    thy   sin,    Who   heal  - eth    all     thy     weak - ness,   Re     - news    thy   life   with - in;     Whose    grace   and   care     are    end   - less;   Who   saved   thee    through   the   past;   Who   leaves   no      suf   - f’rer   friend - less,   But   rights   the     wronged   at    last,   But   rights   the     wronged   at    last.   
verse      He      shows   to    man     His   treas - ure    Of    judg - ment,    truth,   and    right - eous  - ness,   His   love   be   - yond       all    mea  - sure,   His   yearn  - ing    pit  - y      o’er    dis    - tress;   Nor   treats   us    as      we      mer   - it,    But     lays    His    an   - ger   by.     The   hum   - ble,   con   - trite   spir - it      Finds    His     com - pas  - sion   nigh;   And      high    as    heav’n   a    - bove    us,     As    break   from    close     of    day,    So    far,     since   He      doth    love     us,     He    puts     our     sins      a   - way,    He    puts     our     sins      a   - way.    
verse      For     as      a     ten   - der   fa    - ther   Has   pit  - y        on       His    chil  - dren    here,   He    in     His    arms       will   gath - er      All   who      are    His    in     child - like     fear.    He    knows    how   frail   our     pow   - ers    Who     but     from   dust   are   made;   We    flour - ish    like    the     flow - ers,    And      e     - ven   so     we     fade;   The      wind    but   o’er     them   pass  - es,     And   all     their   bloom     is    o’er.   We    with   - er      like    the     grass  - es;     Our   place    knows   us        no    more,   Our   place    knows   us        no    more.   
verse      God’s   grace   a   - lone    en  - dur   - eth,   And   chil - dren’s   chil   - dren   yet     shall   prove   How   He     with   strength   as   - sur  - eth     The   hearts   of     all    that   seek    His      love.    In    Heav’n   is    fixed   His     dwell - ing,   His     rule    is     o    - ver   all;    An  - gels,   in     might   ex    - cel  - ling,   Bright   hosts   be  - fore   Him    fall.   Praise   Him     who   ev     - er     reign - eth,    All   ye      who     hear      His   word,   Nor   our      poor    hymns   dis   - dain   - eth—    My    soul,    now     bless     the   LORD;   My    soul,    now     bless     the   LORD!
