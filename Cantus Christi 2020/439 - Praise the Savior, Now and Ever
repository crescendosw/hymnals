Through   His    mer  - it     We        in       - her  - it     Light   and    peace   and   hap   - pi   - ness.    
verse      Sin’s    bonds   sev  - ered,   We’re      de  - liv  - ered;   Christ   has    crushed   the   ser   - pent’s   head.    Death    no    long - er     Is       the       strong - er;    Hell   it  - self    is     cap  - tive   led.
