verse      Set     me   in      Your   way,   O     LORD;   From   Your   truth    I’ll   not       de  - part;     So      that   I          may   fear   Your   name,   Give     me     a      u    - ni    - ted   heart.   Lord,   with   all    my    heart,   I     will    Praise   Your     name    un  - ceas - ing - ly.    For    Your   love   to     me     is   great;   From    the   grave   You    res - cued   me.     
verse      God,    a    crowd   of     bru  - tal   men     Rise   a    - gainst   me,    seek    - ing   strife;   They,   with   no         re  - gard   for    You     Joined   to     take   a    - way     my    life.    You,    Lord   God,   are   mer    - ci  - ful,    Gra    - cious,   kind,   com - pass - ion - ate,   Slow   to     an   - ger,   rich   in   love,    Faith - ful   to      Your   cov - e    - nant.

Give    me     strength   and   save   my     life;   On       Your   ser  - vant   grace   be  - stow.    Grant   a      sign   of    fav    - or,   LORD,   Which    my       en    - e   - mies   may   see;   They   will   then   be     put    to   shame,   For     You   help    and    com - fort   me.
