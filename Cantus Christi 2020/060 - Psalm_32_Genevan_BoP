verse      Blest   is     the    man      whose   tres - pass   is       for - giv   - en,    Whose   sins    are    cov    - ered      in     the   sight   of      Heav  - en.    Blest   is     the       man      a    - gainst   whom,   LORD,   Thou   wilt     Not     count      all   his      in  - iq   - ui   - ty     and     guilt.     How    hap   - py   he,     con    - trite   of     heart   and   low   - ly,     Who     has     con   fessed   his    sins,   O       LORD    most    ho    - ly;     Who     does    not   se   - cret   - ly     Thy   laws    trans - gress,    Whose   spir  - it     har   - bors   no     de  - ceit     - ful   - ness.    
verse      When    I      kept   si     - lent,   sin  - ful    ways     con - don   - ing,   I       pined   a    - way      through   my     in  - ces   - sant    groan - ing.   Thy     hand   weighed   down     on     me       in      my      de   - ceit;    My      strength   was   sapped   as    by     the    sum  - mer’s   heat.      To     Thee,   O    God     of       jus   - tice   and     com - pas   - sion,   I       then    at    last     ac   - knowl - edged   my      trans - gres  - sion.   I       said,   “I    will   con    - fess   my    sins    to      Thee,”    And     all     my     guilt   Thou   hast   for - gi       - ven     me.      
verse      Let     all    the    god    - ly      when   they   grieve   and   suf   - fer    To      Thee,   O      LORD,    their     sup  - pli - ca    - tions   of    - fer.   Sure  - ly     when      floods   of     might  - y       wa    - ters   rise,    They    shall      not   reach    him   who    on     Thee   re    - lies.      Thou   art     a    hid   - ing      place   for    those   who   serve   Thee;   Thou,   might - y     God,     from   trou  - ble     dost    pre   - serve   me.     Songs   of      de  - liv  - erance   ev   - ’ry - where   re    - sound:    Thou    me      with   great   re   - joic - ing   dost       sur   - round.   
verse      I       will   in   - struct   you,    with   my     aid      pro - vide    you,   And     in      your   way      I,        with   My    eye,    will    guide   you.   My      coun - sel       will     be     ev     - er      at      your   side,    And,    keep     - ing   watch,   I     will   with   you    a     - bide.      Be     not     a    fool,   who      has     no     un    - der - stand - ing;    Do      not     be  - have     like   horse   or      mule,   de    - pend  - ing     On      bit     and   bri  - dle      to     con - trol    their   course;   They    dis   - o    - bey     un   - less   re  - strained   by      force.   
verse      With    man  - y      woes     the     wick - ed     are      af  - flict - ed,    But     he      who    trusts   in        God    is    well    pro   - tec   - ted;   Him     will   the       LORD     with   stead  - fast    love    sur  - round.   Those   who        re  - vere     Him   are    with   mer  - cy      crowned.   Be     glad,   O    righ  - teous,   in      the    LORD    re  - joic  - ing;    Ex    - ult     in    Him,     your   ju    - bi    - la    - tion    voic  - ing,    For     light   and   life   He       will   to    you     im    - part.     Now     shout   for    joy,    you    men    of    up       - right   heart.
