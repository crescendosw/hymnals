verse      God     of    venge - ance,   O        Je   - ho   - vah,   God    of       venge  - ance,   O        shine   forth!    Rise   up,     O       You      Judge    of    na    - tions!   Ren  - der     to      the     proud   their   worth.    O      LORD,   how        long   shall   the    wick   - ed,      How     long    shall   the    wick   - ed     boast?   Ar    - ro  - gant     the     words      they   pour    out,    Wick  - ed     men,     a       taunt - ing    host.   
verse      They,   Je  - ho    - vah,    crush    Your   peo  - ple    And    Your     her    - it    - age      dis   - tress.    They   kill    so    - journ  - er       and   wid   - ow;      Mur  - der     they    the     fa    - ther  - less.     And    they    say,       “Je  - ho    - vah    sees     not;     Ja    - cob’s   God     does   not      have   eyes.”   Un    - der - stand,   O       stu      - pid    peo   - ple!    When,   O      fools,   will    you     be     wise?   
verse      Who     the   ear     made,   does     He     hear   not?   Who    formed   eyes,    does    He       not     see?      Who    warns   na    - tions,   does     He    smite   not?     Who    men     teach - es,     knows   not     He?       All    the     thoughts   of     men     the    LORD     sees,    Knows   that    but     a      breath   are    they.    Blest   the   man      whom    You        chas - tise,   LORD,   Whom    You    teach    to      know    Your   way.    
verse      Give    him   rest    from    days     of     trou - ble    Till   the      wick   - ed      be       o’er  - thrown.   Our    LORD    will    not      leave    His   peo   - ple;     Will   a     - ban   - don     not     His     own.      When   to      ev       - ’ry    ver   - dict   giv    - en       Jus   - tice    shall   come   back     a    - gain,    Ev    - ’ry - one      whose   heart      is     up    - right   Will    see    right  - eous    judg  - ment   then.   
verse      Who     for   me      with  - stands   the    wick - ed?    Who    a      - gainst   wrong   pleads   for     me?       If     the     LORD    were     not      my    help  - er,      Soon   my      soul    would   si    - lent    be.       If     I       say,       “My    foot    is     slip   - ping!”   LORD,   Your    mer   - cy     will     up   - hold.    When    my    anx    - ious    thoughts   are    man   - y,      How     Your   com    - forts   cheer   my     soul!   
verse      Can     de  - struc - tive    rul    - ers    join   You    And    by       law      dis   - or     - der     build?    They   con   - spire   a      - gainst   the   right - eous,    Sen  - tence   just    ones    to      be      killed.   But    the     LORD       is     still   my     strong - hold;    God,    my      ref   - uge,   will     re   - pay.     He’ll   for   sin      wipe    out        the    wick  - ed;     Them    the    LORD     our     God     will   slay.
