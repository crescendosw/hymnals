verse      The   lov   - ing  - kind    - ness   of     the     LORD     Shall   grace   the    sa     - cred   page;    His     truth    the   psalm - ist   shall   re    - cord      From   age     to     ris    - ing   age.      For    who      is    he    in    Heav’n   re  - ferred,   In   - tel    - li  - gence    or    form,     That   can       be      named   with   God      the   Word,     In     whom       all   life     is    warm?      Thou     hast   up    - on         E   - gyp    - tian   land     Thy     dread  - ful    venge  - ance    hurled;   And   scat   - tered   with   Thy    might - y       hand       Their   host      through - out     the    world.   Blest   is    the    peo  - ple,    whom    the   voice       Of     con   - science   calls   Thine   own;     Lord,   in     Thy     light    they    shall   re   - joice,   And   seek    to   - wards   Thy    throne.   My   ser  - vant   Da    - vid     have    I     tried,   And    his     good   deeds    al  - low,     My    ho   - ly      oil     I        have      ap  - plied     To    bless   his   hon   - ored   brow.    I     like  - wise   will   ad - vance   his     realm     Where   dis    - tant     o    - ceans   roll;     And     his    right   hand    shall   hold   the    helm     The   bil     - lows   to      con - trol.    But   if     the      shoots   of    such    a       stem    My      dic    - tate   should   re    - fuse;      And    in     their   lives   that    way    con - demn,   Which   grace    to      faith   fore  - shows;     His   daugh - ters   shall   be     sweet   and     fair,      As    is      the   lu     - nar   light;    That    faith - ful      type     of    heav’n - ly     care      And   bless  - ing       of      the     night.    Thou   lift - est   up      the    hand   that   throws   The    spear      a   - gainst   his     breast,   Thou   hast    de    - light - ed    all    his    foes      Which   his    do - mains    in  - fest.    
verse      For   I       have   said      that   mer  - cy’s    reign    Hence - for   - ward   shall    com  - mence;   And     fed      by    faith - ful - ness    main  - tain      Her    in    - fi   - nite     ex  - pense.    Or     what     is    he    of    most     ac  - count     A    - mongst   the   pow’rs   be  - low,      That   can       be      lik   - ened   to       the   fount     From   whence     all   hon    - ors   flow?      Thine    are    the     heav’ns,   and   bright   ar   - ray      That    in       suc  - ces    - sion    shine,    The   earth,   Thy     firm   foun - da    - tions   stay,      And     all       there   - in      is     Thine.   They    in    Thy    name   shall   take    de  - light,      Each   con   - se      - crat  - ed      hour;    And     make   their   boast,   as      they    re   - cite     Thy   deeds   of     right - eous   pow’r.    My   hand   his    scep  - ter     shall   up  - hold,    And    keep    him    in       his   seat;    And   My     right   arm     shall    make      him   bold      Op  - pos   - ers   to      de   - feat.    He    shall   in   - voke   My   name    in      pray’r,   And     in       My       ser  - vice    live,     “My     God    om    - nip   - o     - tent   to     spare,   My    Fa      - ther   to      for - give.    If    they   should   break    the   ho    - ly      laws    Which   My       com  - mand   - ments   urge,      I      will   My      zeal  - ous     an   - gel   cause   Their   dire     of    - fense   to      scourge.   But   Thou    hast   with    ab   - hor   - rence   spurned    And   Thine   a   - noint  - ed    left;     Thine   own     to       in     - dig - na     - tion   turned,   And   of       Thy       grace   be    - reft.     No     long - er    is      his    weap - on     edged    To     boast      ten   thou   - sands   slain,    And    vic   - to    - ry      no    more   is     pledged   For     his    re - nowned   cam - paign.   
verse      I     have    re   - newed     with   Mine   e     - lect     My      cov   - e    - nant     of     peace,   And     sworn    to    this    be  - nign    ef    - fect      To     him     that   kept     the   fleece.   A    - mid      the   syn - od    of       the   blest,    The    LORD     is    great  - ly    feared;   And    with      in    - ces   - sant   pray’r   ad  - dressed   By     souls      of    saints   in  - sphered.   Thou     hast   di    - vid      - ed    north    and    south,   Bleak   wind     and    ge     - nial    flame;    And   fra    - grant   Her  - mon    finds   a       mouth,     And     Ta      - bor       sings   Thy    name.    Thou    art   the    glo  - ry      of      our   strength,   In     safe  - guard     of      as    - sault;   And     in     the     bless  - ed      Lamb    at     length   Our   horn    Thou   shalt   ex   - alt.      In - vid  - ious   foes    shall   have    no    force    When   he      his    troops   a   - larms,   The   son    of      fraud   shall    have      re  - course    To    fight   be  - fore    his    arms.    And   I       his    ped  - i  - gree    will    fix       A     - mongst   ce     - les  - tial    things,   Whose   race   and     rank    with    an   - gels   mix      A   - bove      all    earth - ly    kings.   But   yet    I        will     not   whol  - ly      take    My      kind   - ness   from     his     seed;      Nor    void   that    bless - ed      prom - ise   make    To      which    My      truth   a     - greed.     The   cov   - e    - nant    is     of      no      trust,     If    thus    his   days     he    drag,     And     o’er    his      crown,   de  - filed    in     dust,     His   foes     blas    - pheme   and     brag.     Nor    more   his   bloom - ing    hon  - ors    glow     With   heav’n’s   ef  - ful    - gent    beam;     His    em    - i     - nence   is    lev  - eled   low,      And     made   of   no       es  - teem.    
verse      Thy   house   I      will      for  - ev   - er      build,   And     in      thy    seed     de   - scend;   The     throne   of    Da    - vid   shall   be      filled,   And    flour - ish    with   - out   end.      O      LORD,    in  - com - pa  - ra     - ble   God,      Thy    truth    a   - round    we    hail,     From   heav’ns   first   con   - vex,   to       the   sod       That   sheathes   the   hum    - ble   vale.      Strong   is     Thine   arm        in    deeds    of     love,    Thy     hand     of     peer   - less    proof;    Thy   right    hand    bran - dish - es      a     - bove       The     heav’ns   in      - te    - rior   roof.    For     God   is     our    re    - doubt - ed    fort,       And    our     de      - fense   sus   - tains,   And     o’er   each    prov   - ince,   coast   and    port     The   Lord    Je   - ho    - vah    reigns.   I    will   his    en    - e     - mies    de  - stroy    My   - self,   be   - fore     his   eyes;    And   with   the     bit   - t’rest   plagues   an  - noy       Who - e’er    his   worth   de   - spise.   My    mer   - cy     and    my   aid     shall   be        For     ev     - er       on     his     side;     And     by     the     grant   I       now    de   - cree     I     sure    - ly     will    a   - bide.    I     will   for      My       own   glo   - ry      care,   Nor     charge   the    Word     I       passed,    Once   in     my      ho    - li    - ness   I     sware   That    Da     - vid’s   house   shall   last.      A   - round   his    bor   - ders   are     in    - fringed,   And   all     the   tow’rs   he    barred;   The     moats   filled   up,      the   gates    un   - hinged,   The   strong   mu      - ni    - tions   marred.   The    rip  - er    days    Thou   hast   cut    off      Of     all        his   bet    - ter     age,      And    giv’n   his     glo   - ry    to     the    scoff     Of      ob   - lo - quy      and   rage.    
verse      O     LORD,   the    heav’ns   with   sap  - phire   ceiled   And     all     the    lights   that   blaze,   Their   truth    af  - fords   a     beau  - teous   field     For    so    - cial   saints   to    praise.   Thou   rulest   the   rag - ing   of       the   sea,      When   surg   - es    foam     and   chase,    Thou   bidst     con   - tend  - ing    waves    a   - gree,     To     send       the   na     - vy    safe.      Jus    - tice   and     eq       - ui  - ty       be   - neath    Thy     throne   have   placed   their   seat;     But   truth    and     love   Thy    Spir  - it      breathe,   And     Thy       bright    pres  - ence   greet.   The     vi  - sion - ar   - y       word    of    late        Thou   deign - est       to      dis   - close;   A       man    by      grace    and     na    - ture   great    I     have    pre  - pared   and    chose.    My   mer  - cy     shall   be      with    his   sword,   My     truth   his    acts     a   - dorn;    And   by     his     fer   - vent     pray’r    im  - plored,   I     will    ex  - alt     his    horn.    Son   af    - ter    son    he   shall   en    - dure,     His     off    - spring   will   I       raise;    And     his    suc   - ces   - sion    will   se   - cure     As    heav’ns   e    - ter   - nal   days.    The   line   of       his      de  - scent   shall   run     With    death  - less   he     - ros     crowned;   Be   - fore   My      pres  - ence,   as     the   sun,    His     throne   shall   be      re    - nowned.    All   those   that   pass    a    - long    the     road,      Up  - on      his   goods    en  - croach,   And     ev    - ’ry      neigh  - bor   comes    to     goad      His   con    - science   with    re    - proach.   For  - ev   - er,   LORD,   wilt   Thou   re   - tire     From   my         sub - mis    - sive    suit?     And    shall   Thine   an    - ger   burn   like   fire      In      this   my   dis    - re  - pute?
