verse      Once     I     said,   “I      must   keep   qui  - et     Lest    I     sin     in     harsh    dis  - pute.    Just   to     see      the    wick  - ed    near   me     An    - gers   me,     but   I       stay   mute.”    Yet    I      could   not     hold     my     fu    - ry,     Burned   to    vent    my      sharp   cri - tique;    Then    at     last,   I     had    to     speak:    
verse      “LORD,   are   You     re    - veal - ing    lim  - its,   How     my    days    look   in       Your   sight?   Just   a      breath   and    fleet - ing   shad - ow     Slip  - ping   by      in    use   - less   flight?   Yes,   I      know    our     lives    are    frag  - ile,    That     we    seem    to      work    in    vain—     All     we     have    is    oth  - ers’   gain.     
verse      “Why,    O     Lord,   must    I      keep   wait - ing    When    my    hope    is     still    in     You?     Keep   me,    Lord,    from   sin     and   trou - ble,   From    the    wrong   I     would   pur  - sue.      Save   me     from    the     fool’s   loud   laugh - ter—    I        was   si    - lent;   I       for - got:      You     con  - trol    my    trou - bled   lot.      
verse      “But,    my    Lord,   Your    heav - y      bur  - den    Wears   me    out     and    weighs   me     down.    All    Your   dis    - ci   - pline   for   sin  - ning   Hurts   and    bows    me    to      the    ground.   Must   You    eat     a     - way      my     treas - ures    Like     a     moth?   I’m     but     a     breath.   Are     You    fac   - ing   me     with   death?    
verse      “Can     You   see,    LORD,   I      am     cry  - ing?   Do      not   spurn   my     sore     un   - rest.    I      pass   by       like   those   be  - fore   me,    Yet     I      claim   to    be      Your   guest!    No     more   sad   - ness—   give     me     glad  - ness,   Be       my    hope    be    - fore    I     cease.    Lord,   dear   Lord,   I     beg    for    peace.”
