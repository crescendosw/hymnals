verse      Do     you      speak   right   de   - crees,   you    mute?    Or     rule    for    truth,   you      judg  - es?     Oh    no,    your    crook - ed      hearts   pol  - lute;     Your   hands   hold    sec   - ret     grudg - es!      In  - stead   of     weigh - ing   truth    and   right,   Your     ver  - dicts   foul   the    earth   with   blight.   For    you     were   born    cor - rupt  - ed.      
verse      The    wick   - ed      stray   from   birth;   they   lie!     They   drip    with   ser    - pent’s   poi   - son.    As    co   - bras    turn    a       haught - y      eye       And    deaf,   they    will    not     list  - en.      The   charm - er     plays   his   lur    - ing   flute;   They     will   not     sway   to     his     pur  - suit.     De   - spite   his    skill - ful   charm - ing.     
verse      God,   break    the     teeth   with   which    they   bite,    As     li    - on     fangs,   LORD,    break   them!   Let   them   be      wat   - er,     quick    in     flight;   Let    run   - ning    pan   - ic      take    them!    And   when    he     bends   his   bow      to    aim,     Let      all    his     ar   - rows   fall    in     shame,    Like   kind  - ling   cut     to    splin - ters.    
verse      Like   snails   which   melt    a    - way      in     slime,   Like   still - born   bab    - ies,     blind   them.   In  - ter    their   bones   in      graves   of     grime;    The    sun     shall   nev   - er      find    them.    Be  - fore    your   pots    can   feel     the   fire,    He’ll    take   them    in     His    burn  - ing    ire;      His    liv   - ing,   an    - gry   whirl - wind.    
verse      The    right  - eous    shall   re   - joice    to     see      The    wick  - ed     slain    in       venge - ance.   His   feet   shall   wade    their   blood    with   glee,     When   God     ful   - fills   their   sen   - tence.   So    men     will   all     be    forced   to    say,     “There   is     a       God    who    wins    the    day,      And    He      re   - wards   the   right - eous!”
