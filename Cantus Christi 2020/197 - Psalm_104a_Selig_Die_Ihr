verse      Praise   the     LORD,     my     soul!    O     praise   Him!    LORD      my     God,    You    are    so     great!    Wrapped   in      light    as   with   a     gar  - ment,    Clothed   in     maj  - es   - ty      and      state.   Like    a      tent    He     spreads   the    heav   - ens,     And    a    - bove     the      wa    - ters   there   Sets   the    frame - work   of       His   dwell - ing,     Mak  - ing     it      an     up    - per   layer.   
verse      He       makes   clouds    of     heav’n   His   char   - iot;    On        the    wings   of     wind   He     rides.    He        makes   flames   of   fire   His   ser  - vants;   Winds     o    - bey    what   He      de     - cides.   He      set    earth   on     its       foun - da     - tions,   So     that   it       should   ne    - ver    move;   Then   the    deep    sub  - merged   the   moun  - tains    Till   the     wa    - ters   stood   a   - bove.    
verse      But      when    You       re   - buked    the   wa     - ters,   At        Your   thun  - der    they   took   flight;   They      re    - ced    - ed   to     the   val  - leys,    Flow    - ing    down   the    moun  - tains’   height   To      the    place   that   You       ap   - point  - ed.      You    set    bounds   to       their   do   - main,   So     that   nev   - er     will     the   wa    - ters     O    - ver   - whelm   the    land    a   - gain.    
verse      God      makes   springs   pour   down     the   val    - leys.   Streams   that   flow    from   ev   - ’ry    hill      Quench    the     thirst   of   all    His   crea - tures,   And       wild   don  - keys   drink   their    fill.    Birds   sing   sweet - ly     in        the    branch - es,      Nest - ing    by       the      riv   - er   - side.   From   a    - bove,   the    earth    is    wa    - tered,   By     God’s   boun  - ty     sat   - is  - fied.
