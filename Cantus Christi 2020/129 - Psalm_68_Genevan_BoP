verse      God    shall     a    - rise,    and      by      His    might     Put     all     His   en   - e     - mies     to    flight;   In      con   - quest   shall   He     quell   them.   Let   those   who      hate    Him,   scat   - tered,   flee     Be    - fore    His   glo   - rious   maj   - es    - ty,      For      God      Him   - self    shall   fell   them.   Just   as      the    wind     drives   smoke   a   - way,     So    God    will   scat   - ter     the    ar     - ray      Of     those   who      e        - vil     cher - ish.     As    wax     that   melts    be   - fore    the    fire,    So     van  - quished   by      God’s   dread - ful    ire,     Shall   all      the     wick  - ed    per    - ish.    With     might - y      char     - iot   - ry      un     - told,      His    host    ten   thou   - sand   thou - sand - fold,     The    Lord    came   to      His    na    - tion.   From   Si    - nai’s   mount    He      made   His      way      To      Zi   - on,    which   He      made    for    aye      His      ho     - ly     hab    - i      - ta   - tion.    Thou   didst,   O       LORD,      as   - cend     a      - gain,    With    man   - y     cap     - tives   in       Thy    train    And     gifts   from    men     ob   - tain - ing,     From   ev     - en     those     who      did      re     - bel,    That   here     the     LORD    our   God        may     dwell,   Here      ev   - er    - more     re    - main - ing.

O     sing    to       God,    His    praise   pro    - claim    And     raise   a     psalm   un    - to      His     name;    In       joy    - ful     songs   a     - dore   Him.    Lift   up      your   voice    and      sing    a   - loud     To    Him    who    rides    up    - on     the      clouds   High   in      the      spac     - ious    heav - ens.     The   LORD,   that   is       His    glor  - ious   name.    Sing   un   - to        Him     with    loud    ac   - claim;   To      Him      be      glo   - ry    giv    - en.     Blest    be      the    LORD,      who     on      our      way        Pro  - vides   for   us,      and    day    by     day       Up   - holds   us     by      His    pow   - er.     God    of      Sal   - va     - tion    is     His      name;    This    glor - ious   name    shall   we      pro  - claim.   He       is       our    shield   and      tow  - er.      Our    God,     the     LORD,      is     strong   to       save     From    mor   - tal   dan     - ger,    from     the    grave    And     ev    - ’ry     cruel   op   - pres - sion.    But    God      will   crush     the      head     of       foes,   The    hair   - y       crown   of    him        who     goes     In        ways   of      foul     trans - gres - sion.

He    in      the      good  - ness   of       His      grace    Gives   lone  - ly    ones    a       dwell - ing   - place;   He       grants   them    con   - so    - la   - tion.   He     leads   the    cap    - tive     out     to    see      The   joys   of     new    - found   lib  - er     - ty,      For    boun  - teous    is         God’s   mer  - cy.

The      Lord    has    said,      “From   where   they     are,       Yes,   e     - ven   though   it     be     from   far,      From   Ba    - shan   I       will   guide   them    And    bring   them    back     by      My     own      hand,    Re    - turn - ing    them    from    dis   - tant   lands,   Though   o      - cean   depths   should   hide   them,    That   you      may     bathe      your   feet     in       blood    Of      those   who   bear      the     wrath    of     God      For     all     their   sin   - ful    ac   - tions;   In     blood    of     foes,     whom     none     can      save,   Your   dogs     their   ea    - ger   tongues    will    lave     Un      - to     their   sat    - is    - fac  - tion.”
