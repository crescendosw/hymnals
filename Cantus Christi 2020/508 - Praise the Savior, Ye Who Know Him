verse      Je     - sus   is      the    name      that   charms   us;    He     for   con   - flict   fits    and   arms     us;    Noth   - ing    moves   and   noth  - ing   harms   us    While   we      trust   in     Him.    
verse      Trust    in    Him,    ye     saints,   for  - ev     - er;    He     is    faith - ful,    chang - ing   nev    - er;    Nei    - ther   force   nor   guile   can   sev   - er    Those   He      loves   from   Him.    
verse      Keep     us,   Lord,   O      keep      us     cleav  - ing    To     Thy - self    and     still   be  - liev   - ing,   Till     the    hour    of    our     re  - ceiv  - ing   Prom  - ised    joys    with   Thee.   
verse      Then     we    shall   be     where     we     would    be,    Then   we    shall   be      what    we    should   be;    Things   that   are     not   now,    nor   could   be,   Soon    shall   be      our    own.
