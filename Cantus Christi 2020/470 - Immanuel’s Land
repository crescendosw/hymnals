verse      Oh,    Christ,   He     is    the       foun - tain,   The   deep,    sweet    well    of        love!   The    streams   on    earth   I’ve   tast - ed;    More   deep   I’ll    drink   a   - bove:    There   to      an    o      - cean   full - ness    His     mer   - cy       doth    ex     - pand,     And    glo     - ry,     glo - ry    dwell - eth   In     Im - man - uel’s   land.   
verse      With   mer     - cy     and   with      judg - ment    My    web      of       time    He        wove,   And    aye       the   dews    of     sor  - row    Were   lus  - tered   with    His   love;    I’ll    bless   the   hand     that   guid - ed,     I’ll    bless   the      heart   that     planned   When   throned   where   glo - ry    dwell - eth   In     Im - man - uel’s   land.   
verse      I’ve   wres    - tled   on    towards   Heav - en,     A   - gainst   storm,   wind    and       tide,   Now,   like      a     wea   - ry     trav - ’ler   That   lean - eth     on      his   guide,   A     - mid     the   shades   of     eve  - ning,   While   sinks   life’s   lin   - g’ring   sand,     I      hail      the     glo - ry    dawn  - ing   From   Im - man - uel’s   land.   
verse      Oh,    I         am     my    Be      - lov  - ed’s    And   my       Be     - lov   - ed’s      mine!   He     brings    a     poor    vile   sin  - ner    In   - to     His     house   of    wine.    I       stand   up  - on       His    mer  - it—     I       know    no       oth   - er       stand,    Not    ev’n      where   glo - ry    dwell - eth   In     Im - man - uel’s   land.   
verse      The    bride     eyes   not   her       gar  - ment,   But   her      dear     bride - groom’s   face;   I      will      not   gaze    at     glo  - ry     But    on     my      King    of    grace.   Not     at      the   crown    He     giv  - eth     But     on      His      pierc - ed       hand;     The    Lamb      is      all   the   glo   - ry    Of     Im - man - uel’s   land.
