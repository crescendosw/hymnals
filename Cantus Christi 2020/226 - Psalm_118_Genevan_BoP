Come   to       the   LORD   with   your    thanks - giv  - ing;     His   ev       - er   - last  - ing   love   en   - dures.   I’ll    thank   the   LORD;   now   let      me     en   - ter.    Un    - lock    the   gates   of     right - eous - ness.    The    right - eous     shall      here   be     ad  - mit  - ted,    For   this   in  - deed   the   LORD’s   gate   is.      I      thank   Thee,   LORD,   that      Thou   hast   heard   me      And    res  - cued   me     from   my      dis - tress.   Thou    hast    be   - come,   LORD,   my    sal - va   - tion;   All   those    who       seek    Thee   wilt   Thou    bless.   
verse      I      cried   to     God       in      my     af   - flic  - tion;    He      an   - swered   me      and    set    me    free.    The    LORD     Him   - self      is     my      pro - tec   - tion.   What   can      a       man    then   do       to     me?      On    all     my     foes      I     look    in    tri    - umph;   With   God    I     face    them   fear  - less  - ly.     I’ll   put      no    con  - fi   - dence   in       prin - ces;     The   LORD,      He     shall   my    re   - fuge   be.      The     stone   the   build - ers   had      re   - ject - ed      Was     cho   - sen   as      the    cor   - ner  - stone.

This   is      the     day     the       LORD   cre  - at    - ed;     Now    let    us     sing   with   joy   - ful   tones.   Grant   us      pros - per   - i     - ty,   we    pray   Thee;   O     LORD,    save      those   who    are    Thine   own.     
verse      I      was     sur  - round   - ed      by     all    na    - tions,   But     I      sub    - dued    them   in     His   name;    And    though   they    swarmed   like   bees    a     round   me,     I      beat     them    down   like   thorns   a    - flame.   I     was     hard - pressed   and   close   to    fall   - ing;    To     my     sup - port    the    LORD    then    came.   He     is       my    song   and    my      sal    - va   - tion;    His   strength   is     ev    - er  - more   the    same.    Blest   he      who   in      the   LORD’s   name   en   - ters!   We      bless   you   from    the    house   of     God.     He     is      our      strength   and    our    sal - va   - tion;   The   LORD   has   shed   His   light    a    - broad.   Bind   fest  - al      of    - f’rings   to     the    al    - tar;    With   sac  - ri   - fi   - ces    bring   Him   laud.    Shout   forth   your   joy     with  - in    His   tem  - ple.    O     praise   the       LORD,   for    He     is      God.

Al   - though   the   LORD   has    sore  - ly       chas - tened,   He    has        from   death   de  - liv  - ered   me.      Thou    art     my    God;    I     will     ex   - tol    Thee.
