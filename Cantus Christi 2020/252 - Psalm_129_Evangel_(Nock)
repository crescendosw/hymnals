verse      From    my      youth   up,      may     Is    - rael    say,     They    oft     have   me     as    - sailed,   Re    - duced   me     oft      to     heav  - y     straits,   But     nev   - er     quite   pre  - vailed.    
verse      Oft     have    they    plowed   my      pa    - tient   back     With    fur   - rows   deep   and     long;     My      right - eous   God      has    broke   the   chains,    And     res   - cued   me      from   wrong.     
verse      De    - feat,   con   - fu     - sion,   shame - ful     rout,    Are     still   the    doom   of      those,    Their   right - eous   doom,    who    Zi    - on    hate,      And     Zi    - on’s   God     op   - pose.      
verse      Like    grass   up    - on       the     house - top     wilts,   Un    - time  - ly     let    them    fade,     Which   too     much   heat,    and    want    of    root,      Has     blast - ed     in      the    blade,     
verse      Which   in      his     arms     no      reap  - er      takes,   But     un    - re   - gard - ed      leaves;   Nor     bin   - der    thinks   it     worth   his   pains      To      fold    it     in    - to     sheaves.   
verse      No      trav  - el    - er       that    pass  - es      by,      Vouch   safes   a      min  - ute’s   stop,     To      give    it     one      kind   look,   or    crave      God’s   bless - ing    on      the    crop.
