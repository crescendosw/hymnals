verse      I         in      the    LORD   do       put     my      trust:     How     is       it     then     that    ye        Say     to      my     soul,   “Flee   as     a       bird    Un   - to     your   moun - tain     high”?    
verse      For,      lo,     the    wick - ed       bend    their   bow,       Their   shafts   on     string   they    fit,      That    those   who    up    - right   are    in      heart   They   priv - i    - ly     may      hit.      
verse      If        the     foun - da   - tions    be      de    - stroyed,   What    hath     the    right  - eous    done?     God     in      His    ho    - ly      tem  - ple     is,     In     Heav - en     is     His      throne:   
verse      His       eyes    do     see,   His      eye   - lids    try        Men’s   sons.    The    just     He      proves:   But     His     soul   hates   the     wick - ed      man,    And    him    that   vi   - ’lence   loves.    
verse      Snares,   fire    and    brim - stone,   fur   - ious    storms,    On      sin    - ners   He       shall   rain:     This,   as      the    por   - tion    of     their   cup,    Doth   un   - to     them   per    - tain,     
verse      Be      - cause   the    LORD   most     right - eous    doth       In      right  - eous - ness     de    - light;    And     with    a      pleas - ant     coun - te    - nance   Be   - hold - eth    the    up     - right.
