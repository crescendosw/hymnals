verse      What    Child   is      this,     now     laid     to       rest,     With - in       a       rus    - tic    stall?   We    hail   the   Sun     of        right - eous  - ness,     A      gift     of     God    for  - ev   - er    blest,   To    gain     His   ev     - er    - last - ing    hall.    Now    see      Him    in       a     man    - ger     laid,    That   pure     one    un     - de   - filed.   He   came   to    give    what   could    not     fade,    He     came     to    see    the   ran  - som     paid,    With    God      and    sin     - ners   rec    - on  - ciled.     
verse      This    lit   - tle     town      of      Beth   - le     - hem,      Ob   - scured   in      dark   - ness   lies,    But   an   - gel   hosts   did       not     con   - demn;     They   praise   the    roy  - al     di   - a   - dem      And   joined   the   tri    - umph    of     the    skies.   So     veiled   in     flesh    the   God    - head    see,     Let    heav’n   and    na     - ture   sing.    A    wood - en    box,    a      gold   - en      key,     Will   bring    us    to     the   crys - tal     sea      Where   God’s    ca   - the     - dral   bells    all   ring.      
verse      O       come,   O       come,     Em    - man    - u      - el,       Let    jus    - tice,   mer    - cy     kiss,    De  - liv  - er    us      from      death   and     Hell,     And    ran    - som    cap  - tive   Is   - ra  - el,      For   Je     - sus   Christ   was     born   for    this.    It     came     up   - on       a     mid    - night   clear—   Pro  - claim    that   ho     - ly     birth.   To   ban  - ish   guilt   and    shame    and     fear,    The    Christ   of    God    has   now    ap    - peared   And     brings   good   will      and    peace    to    earth.     
verse      While   shep  - herds   watched   their   flocks   by       night,    The    vir    - gin     toiled   and    gave     The   one    de  - sire    of        na    - tions   bright,   To     bring    us     from   e    - ter  - nal   light,   A     Sav    - ior   who      could   ful  - ly     save.    And    so       from   realms   of    end    - less    day      From   ten    - der    stem     hath   sprung   A    bud    to    bloom   in     our      cold    gray.    What   Sa     - tan   and    his   Her  - ods     say,     We      an     - swer   with      our    myr    - iad   tongues.   
verse      So,     Sav   - ior     of        the     na     - tions,   come,     Let    earth    re    - ceive    her    King.    And   let    us    to    - tal       up      the     sum       Of     mer    - cies   in     that   king - dom   come,    And   ech    - o     why      the     an   - gels   sing.    Sing   prais  - es     to       our   Heav’n - ly      Lord,    The    Son      of     love’s   pure   light.   In   man  - ger   and     on     throne   a     - dored,   Be   - fore     Him   all    our   an   - thems   soared   And     there    ex   - pressed   re   - deemed   de  - light.     
verse      These   an    - gels    fill      the     skies    with     praise,   And    moun   - tains   in       re   - ply,     And   prom - ise   that    through   end   - less    days      We     all      will   sing   what   glo  - ry    weighs   And   of     - fer   it       to      God    Most   High.    So     God      im   - parts    to    hu     - man     hearts   The    gift     of     life     a    - gain.    We   sing   in    true    har  - mo     - nious   parts,   And    mim    - ic    high   an  - gel  - ic      arts.    God     rest     ye     mer     - ry,    gen    - tle - men!
