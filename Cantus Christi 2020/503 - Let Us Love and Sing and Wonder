He       has       hushed   the   law’s    loud   thun   - der,    He      has     quenched   Mount   Sin  - ai’s       flame;   He      has    washed   us   with   His   blood,   He     has    brought   us     nigh    to   God.    
verse      Let   us   love      the      Lord     who    bought   us,    Pit    - ied   us       when   en      - e     - mies,    Called   us        by       His   grace    and    taught   us,     Gave    us      ears       and     gave   us         eyes:    He      has    washed   us   with   His   blood,   He     pre  - sents     our    souls   to   God.    
verse      Let   us   sing,     though   fierce   temp - ta     - tion   Threat - en    hard     to     bear      us      down!    For      the       Lord,    our   strong   sal  - va     - tion,   Holds   in      view       the     con  - qu’ror’s   crown.   He      who    washed   us   with   His   blood,   Soon   will   bring     us     home    to   God.
