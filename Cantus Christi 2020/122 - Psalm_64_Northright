verse      Hear   my      voice,   O       God;      heed    my     an     - guish.   Save   me      from    my     foes     lest   they   van    - quish.   Hide     me      from      the    schemes   and      the    plans    which   These     re   - bel  - lious   men        se   - cret  - ly      de  - vise.     
verse      They   have    whet     their   tongues   sharp   as     dag    - gers.    They   aim     cru   - el     darts,   bit  - ter    an     - ger.     They     shoot   blame   - less   men,      make     them   stag   - ger.    There’s   no     fear   of      God        in     their   wick  - ed    hearts.   
verse      With   im    - pu     - ni    - ty        they    are    preen  - ing,     “Who   will    see     our    snares   or     our    schem  - ing?”    What     im    - ag      - in   - ings,     what     dark   dream  - ings    Lie       deep   in     the     thoughts   and    the     heart   of    man!      
verse      With   their   ar     - rows,   Lord,     shoot   and    pierce   them.    Let    their   own     vile   tongue   be     what   spears   them.    Though   they    thought   them - selves    strong   and    fierce   men,    All       who    look   on      them       turn   a     - way     in    scorn.    
verse      But    all     look     on      God       rapt    with   won    - der;     All    His     might - y      deeds    they   will   pon    - der.     Right  - eous    men       will   trust     and      give   hon    - or      To        the    LORD   and     sing       glo  - ry      to      His   name.
