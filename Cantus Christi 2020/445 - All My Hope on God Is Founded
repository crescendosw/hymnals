verse      All     my      hope   on      God     is   found - ed;    He      doth    still   my     trust    re  - new,       Me      through   change   and   chance   He   guid  - eth,   On    - ly    good     and   on      - ly    true.     God      un      known,   He     a   - lone    Calls   my     heart    to     be      His   own.     
verse      Pride   of      man    and     earth - ly   glo   - ry,    Sword   and     crown   be   - tray     His   trust;     What    with      care     and   toil     He   build - eth,   Tow’r   and   tem    - ple   fall      to    dust.     But      God’s   pow’r,   Hour   by    hour,   Is      my     tem    - ple    and     my    tow’r.   
verse      God’s   great   good - ness    aye     en - dur   - eth,   Deep    His     wis   - dom,   pass   - ing   thought:   Splen - dor,      light    and   life     at - tend    Him,   Beau  - ty    spring - eth   out       of    naught.   Ev     - er    - more     From   His   store   New   - born   worlds   rise   and     a   - dore.    
verse      Dai   - ly      doth   th’al - might - y    Giv   - er     Boun  - teous   gifts   on     us       be  - stow;      His     de      - sire     our   soul     de - light - eth,   Pleas - ure   leads    us    where     we    go.       Love     doth    stand    At     His   hand;   Joy     doth   wait     on     His     com - mand.    
verse      Still   from    man    to      God     e  - ter   - nal    Sac   - ri    - fice    of     praise   be    done,      High    a       - bove     all   prais  - es   prais - ing    For     the   gift     of    Christ,   His   Son.      Christ   doth    call     One    and   all:    Ye      who    fol    - low    shall   not   fall.
