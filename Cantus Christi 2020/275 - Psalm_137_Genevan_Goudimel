verse      How   shall   we     sing      the   LORD’s   song   in       our     an    - guish   When   in    a      for   - eign   land    we       mourn   and    lan   - guish?   Je   - ru  - sa    - lem,   for    love     of    you    I      cry;    My      right   hand   with - er     if     I     you     de  - ny.      My      mouth   be    dumb   if    ev     - er    I       for  - get    you,      If      not    a   - bove    my    high - est     joy       I      set     you!
