verse      O       my     peo   - ple,    hear    my         teach - ing;    Par  - a      - bles     I       will    un   - fold.   Give   at   - ten   - tion    as       I       ut  - ter      Dark     and     hid   - den     things   of      old—    Things   that    we     have    heard   and     known;   By      our    fa    - thers   they   were    shown.   He     showed   won   - ders     to     their     fa   - thers     While   they   were    in      E      - gypt’s   land—     Split   the    sea      and    led      them   through   it,      Wa      - ters   heaped   on    ei    - ther   hand.    With    the     cloud    He     led     by      day;    Fire   by    night   re   - vealed   their   way.     From    the     heav’ns   He     loosed   the    east    wind,    Led     the   south   wind   forth   with   pow’r.     Meat,   like    dust,    He      rained   up    - on     them,   Birds   like    sand    up   - on       the    shore.      In     the     camp     came    down     the     quail,    All    a    - round   their   tents    like   hail.     
verse      We      will   tell    them    to      our        chil  - dren,   Gen  - er     - a      - tions   yet     to     come;   We     will   show    the     LORD’s   great   pow - er       And      the     won   - ders    He       has     done.   Laws     for     Is   - ra    - el      He      made,    Stat  - utes   firm    to      be     o     - beyed.   In     the      de    - sert     God    brought   wa   - ter       From    the    rock    to      quench   their    thirst—   Wa    - ters   brim   - ming   like     the    o       - cean,    Streams   from   rock   - y     crags   that   burst.   But     they    al     - ways   would   de    - fy      And    re  - ject    Him,   God      Most    High.    Thus    in      glut    - ton  - y        they   feast - ed,      For     He    gave    them   their   de   - sire.      But     be    - fore     they    fin    - ished   eat  - ing     God’s   dis   - pleas - ure    blazed   like   fire.       So     their   stout  - est     war    - riors   fell,     And    the    youth   of      Is     - ra   - el.       
verse      These   He     or    - dered   our     fore     - fa    - thers   To     their    fam    - i     - lies    to     tell,   So     the    com   - ing     gen    - er    - a   - tion,    Not      yet     born,   would   know     them    well,   And      their   chil - dren,   in      their   turn,    God’s   com    mands   and     laws   would   learn.   In     the      de    - sert     God    they      chal   lenged:   Can     He     sat   - is    - fy       our      taste?    When    he     struck   the    rock,    it     o       - pened,   Down      the    crag     the   wa    - ters   raced.   Now     our     thirst   is     sat   - is    - fied,   Can    He    food    for    us       pro   - vide?”   Still   they    dis     - be   - lieved   His    won   - ders,    Kept    on    sin   - ning   none  - the  - less.      So      He      closed   their   days     in      ter  - ror     And     their   years   in     emp    - ti   - ness.       When   He      pun    - ished   them,    they    turned,   And    with   zeal    for     Him      they   burned.   
verse      Then    to     God     they    would   be         faith - ful,    Mind - ful      of       what    He      had    done—   Not    like   their   dis   - loy    - al      fa  - thers,   Stub   - born    re    - bels    ev     - ’ry     one;    For      God’s   Word   they    had     de    - nied     And     His    pre   - cepts   they   de    - fied.    When   the      LORD    heard,   He     was       an   - gry,      And     His    wrath   broke   out      like     fire;     Ja    - cob    knew     His    fierce   dis  - pleas   - ure,     Is      - ra   - el       His   right - eous   ire.     Faith   in      God      they   cast    a     - side    And    His   sav   - ing    pow’r    de    - nied.    God     their   Rock      they   then     re   - mem   - bered,   Their   Re  - deem  - er,    God     Most   High;      But     their   words    were    meant    to      flat - ter,    What    they    told    Him    was      a      lie.        In     their   hearts   they    were     un    - true;     From   His    cov   - ’nant   they     with - drew.     
verse      Such    were   those   of      E     - phraim’s   ar    - my      Who,   though   strong   and     armed   with   bows,   To     the    cov   - ’nant   were     dis   - loy - al,      Turned   their   back    up    - on       their   foes.   They     for   - got    what    God     had     done,    And     the    won   - ders    He     had     shown.   To     the      skies   He       gave   the       or   - der;      Heav  - en’s   doors   He      o      - pened    wide.     Man   - na     rained   down   for      His    peo     - ple;     Grain     of     heav   - en    He      sup  - plied.   An    - gels’   bread    lay    at      their   feet;   They   had   all     that   they     could   eat.     Yet     in      mer     - cy     He       for  - gave    them;    From    de  - struc - tion   He      re   - frained.   Man   - y       times    He      curbed   His     an   - ger     And     His     ut    - most   wrath    re     strained.   That   they    were     but     flesh,   He      knew—     Like   a      pass  - ing     breeze   that   blew.
