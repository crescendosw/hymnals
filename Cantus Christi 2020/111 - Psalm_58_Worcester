verse      You   may    be   gods,   but     can      you     claim    That    you     speak    right  - eous - ness?    And    do      you   judge   the     sons    of     men     In     truth   and    up    - right - ness?    No,       e    - ven      in     your   ver    - y       heart,   You    wick  - ed   - ness     pro   - duce;    On      earth   you    weigh    out   with    your   hands    Your      vi    - o      - lent      a    - buse.     
verse      The   wick - ed   from    their   day      of      birth    Are     stran - gers     to       the    way;     They   from    the   womb    come    speak - ing    lies;   They   wan   - der    far     a     - stray.   They      have   the      ven  - om     of       a       snake,   They   have    an     ad     - der’s   ear      Which   they    have   closed   to    charm   er’s   songs;   Skilled   charm - ers      they’ll   not    hear.     
verse      O     God,   in - side    their   o      - pened   mouths   Break   off     their    cru    - el     teeth;   The    fangs   of    these   young   li    - ons,   LORD,   Tear   out     by     roots   be    - neath.   Let       them   like     run  - off    wat    - ers     be       That   leave   the    ground   soon    dry.     Let     ar    - rows   that     he    aims    be   - come     Like      head  - less     shafts    that   fly.      
verse      Let   them   be   like    the     snails   that    melt     A     - long    the      course   they   run;     Or     like    one   pre   - ma    - ture  - ly     born    Who    ne    - ver    sees    the     sun.     They      are    like     blaz - ing    thorns   which   You      Be   - neath   Your   ket    - tles    lay.     Whose   heat    is     scarce - ly    felt    be   - fore     A         wind    sweeps   them      a    - way.      
verse      The   just   re - joi   - ces     when     he      sees     That    ven   - geance   is       com  - plete,   For    in      the   blood   of      wick  - ed     men     He     then    will   wash    his     feet.    They’ll   say,   “There   sure - ly     is       re    - ward     For    right - eous   ones     of      worth;   There   sure  - ly     is       a     liv   - ing    God      Who       jud   - ges      in        the    earth.”
