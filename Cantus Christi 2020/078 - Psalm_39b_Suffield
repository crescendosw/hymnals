verse      Teach   me       the    mea  - sure   of     my     days,    Thou   Mak  - er       of      my    frame;   I      would   sur - vey       life’s   nar  - row      space,   And   learn      how     frail    I     am.      
verse      A       span     is     all    that   we     can    boast,   An     inch   or       two     of    time;    Man    is      but   van     - i      - ty     and      dust     In    all        his     flow’r   and   prime.   
verse      See     the      vain   race   of     mor  - tals   move     Like   sha  - dows     o’er    the   plain;   They   rage    and   strive,   de     - sire   and      love,    But   all        their   noise    is    vain.    
verse      Some    walk     in     hon  - or’s   gau  - dy     show,    Some   dig    for      gold  - en    ore;     They   toil    for   heirs     they     know   not      who,     And   straight   are     seen     no    more.    
verse      What    should   I      wish   or     wait   for,   then,    From   crea   tures,   earth   and   dust?    They   make    our   ex      - pec    - ta   - tions    vain,    And   dis      - ap    - point    our   trust.   
verse      Now     I        for  - bid    my     car  - nal    hope,    My     fond   de     - sires   re  - call!    I      give    my    mor     - tal      in   - terest   up       And   make       my      God      my    all.
