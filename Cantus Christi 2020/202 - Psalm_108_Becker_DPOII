I      sing;   the   dawn   a   - wak - ens.      O         LORD,   I      sing   a  - mong   the    tribes;   My     song    to      You      all     strength   a     - scribes.   I’ll    praise   a      - mong    the   na    - tions.   
verse      Your     mer    - cy’s    great   a   - bove   the   sky,    Your   truth   a    - scends   to     heav  - en.     A   - rise,   O      God,   a    - bove   the    sky;     Your   splen - dor   o’er   cre - a   - tion;     That      Your    be   - lov  - ed   be     set    free,     Hold   out     Your    strong   right   hand       to      me;        Re    - spond    and      grant   sal - va    - tion.    
verse      God      ans    - wered   in      His   ho   - li  - ness,   “I     will    re   - joice    in     tri   - umph;   The   lot     of     She  - chem   I      as   - sess,    And    judge   the   Vale   of    Suc - coth.     The       land    of     Gil  - e  - ad     is     Mine,     I      claim   Ma    - nas    - seh,    too,       as      Mine;      And     E      - phraim   is      My    hel   - met.     
verse      “While   Ju     - dah     is      My    law  - yer - king,   Yet    Mo    - ab     is       my     soap  - dish;   My    shoe,   o’er   E    - dom,   I      will   fling;   Phil - is    - ti  - a      I     van - quish.”   Now       who     will   give   me   safe   re   - sort?     Or     lead    me      in     - to      E        - dom’s   fort?      Did     You      not      let     us    lan   - guish?   
verse      Was      it       not     You     who   sent   us    out     But    did     not    join     our    forc  - es?     Pro - vide    us     help   from   trou - ble    now!     The    help    of    man    is    use - less.     Through   God     we     will   do   val  - iant - ly,       For    He      shall   win      our     vic      - to    - ry,        He’ll   tram   - ple      our     dis - tress - es.
