verse      We      thank   Thee,   Lord,     for    this      fair   earth,    The    glit  - t’ring   sky,    the     sil  - ver   sea;     For    all     their   beau  - ty,   all     their   worth,    Their   light   and    glo  - ry,     come    from   Thee.     
verse      Thine   are     the     flow’rs   that   clothe    the    ground,   The    trees   that     wave    their   arms   a   - bove,    The    hills   that    gird    our   dwell - ings    round,    As      Thou    dost   gird   Thine   own     with   love.     
verse      Yet     teach   us      still     how    far       more   fair,     More   glo   - rious,   Fa    - ther,   in     Thy   sight,   Is     one     pure    deed,   one   ho    - ly      pray’r,   One     heart   that   owns   Thy     Spir  - it’s   might.    
verse      So      while   we      gaze      with   thought - ful    eye       On     all     the      gifts   Thy     love   has   giv’n,   Help   us      in      Thee    to    live    and     die,      By      Thee    to     rise   from    earth   to     Heav’n.
