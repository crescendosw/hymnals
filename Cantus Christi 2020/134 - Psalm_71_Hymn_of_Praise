verse      In       You,   O     LORD,    I      put    my    trust;   Shamed   let    me     nev  - er      be;       Oh,    save     me     in     Your   right - eous - ness,   Give    ear     and   res - cue   me.       Oh,     be     my   rock,   my     dwell - ing    place,   Where   I       may      al   - ways   flee;   For   You,      my     rock    and   for  - tress   sure,    Save   me    by     Your       de    - cree.     
verse      De     - liv  - er    me       from   wick - ed    hands,   Save     me     from   men    un    - just,     For    You,     Lord   GOD,   You    are     my     hope;   From    youth   You   are   my    trust.    You     have   up - held    me     in      Your   grace    From    child - hood’s   ear  - ly     days;   To    You       from   whom    I     life   re    - ceived   Will   I     give   con      - stant   praise.   
verse      Though   men    a   - round    in     won  - der   gaze,    You      are    my     ref  - uge     strong.   Your   praise   is     what   I      sing    a    - bout,   Your    glo   - ry    all   day   long.     Don’t   cast   me   off     when   I       grow   old—     When    life    is       al   - most   gone;   Do    not       for  - sake    me    when   I’m     weak,    When   all   my     strength   is      drawn.    
verse      My       foes   are   strong   and    con  - fi  - dent,    They     talk   and    make   their   plans:    “He    is       for  - sak  - en     by      his    God,    He’ll   fall    in  - to    our   hands.”   Do      not    be   far     from   me,     my     God;     Make    haste   to       hear   my     call.   A   - shamed,   con  - sumed   be    all    my      foes,    Dis  - hon - ored   let        them    fall.     
verse      But    I      will   hope     con - tin   - ual  - ly,     And   praise   You   more    and    more.    My     mouth   shall   tell    Your     right - eous - ness,   Your   sav   - ing   works   a    - dore.    The    might - y        deeds   of    GOD     the   Lord      I      can  - not   com  - pre  - hend;     But      I       will    praise   Your    right - eous - ness     Un   - til      my     life   shall   end.       
verse      What   You    have   taught   in    child - hood   days,   I,    old      and   gray,   tell   forth    To     gen   - er    - a     - tions    com   - ing    on,     Your   deeds   of    pow’r   and    worth.   Your   right - eous   - ness    is    high    as    heav’n.   Who    can    com - pare   with   You?      You’ve   shown   me      trou   - bles,   great   and    harsh,   But    You      will   bear   me      through.   
verse      You    will   re   - store    my    life    a    - gain    And   raise    me    from    the    grave.   With   hon   - or      great   You’ll   com   - fort   me,     When   You     my    soul    have   saved.   O      Is    - rael’s   ho    - ly,   faith - ful   One,      With   lyre   and   harp   I’ll   praise.   Those    who     would   hurt     me      You     will   shame.   I’ll   praise   You    all    my      days.
