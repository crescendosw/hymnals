verse      O     God,    lend    me        Your   ear;    Hide    not      from   my        re    - quest - ing.    At   - tend   to     me     and     hear     my    pray’r,   I     moan    a     - loud,   un - rest - ing.     Di  - vide    their   tongues,   O      Lord;     I’ve   seen      their   strife - torn   cit - y.     Its   walls   both    day    and   night   they    guard,   While   at      its     heart   is     cruel - ty.     
verse      The   foe     lifts   up        his    voice   And     wick   - ed     men       op    - press   me.     They   rain   down   trou - ble     to       de  - stroy,    And   in      their   wrath   de - test   me.      De  - struc - tion    plagues    its    midst     Its    streets   are     bound    with   ri  - ot.    If    hurt    by      my     an  - tag   - o     - nist,    Then    I       could   hide    and    bear    it.     
verse      My    heart   is      pained    in     me,     I’m     struck   by     death’s   dread   ter   - ror.    A      quak - ing    fear   comes   like     the   sea;      I     drown   in      waves   of   hor  - ror.     But   it      was     you,       my     friend!   My     own       be    - loved    com  - pan - ion!   We    took    sweet   coun - sel   to      as    - cend     And     join    the     con   - gre  - ga    - tion.   
verse      “I    yearn   for     wings,”   I      said,   “Then   like     the    dove      I’d     find    rest.   I’d    fly    to     de   - sert    haunts   in  - stead,    Es  - cap   - ing     winds   of   tem  - pest.”   Let   death   en    - snare      them   all!      Cast   them      a     - live     to     She - ol!    For   wick  - ed    - ness   a   - dorns   their   hall;    They    dwell   at      home    with   e     - vil.
