verse      Lo,    how       a       rose    e’er     bloom - ing   From   ten     - der    stem    hath   sprung!   Of     Jes     - se’s   lin  - eage    com   - ing,   As    men    of     old     have   sung.    It      came,   a       flow’r  - et     bright,   A    - mid    the      cold     of    win   - ter    When   half  - spent   was   the    night.   
verse      I    - sa      - iah     ’twas   fore   - told    it,   The    rose      I      have    in     mind,     With   Ma      - ry     we     be    - hold    it,    The   vir  - gin    moth  - er     kind.    To      show    God’s   love      a    - right,    She    bore   to       men      a     Sav   - ior    When   half  - spent   was   the    night.   
verse      The    shep    - herds   heard   the      sto   - ry    Pro  - claimed   by     an    - gels   bright,   How    Christ,   the    Lord   of      glo   - ry,    Was   born   on     earth   this   night.   To      Beth  - le    - hem       they   sped      And    in     the      man    - ger   found   Him,   As     an    - gel     her - alds   said.    
verse      This   flow’r,   whose   fra   - grance   ten   - der   With   sweet   - ness   fills   the    air,      Dis  - pels      with   glo  - rious   splen - dor    The   dark - ness   ev    - ’ry  - where.   True    man,    yet     ver     - y      God,      From   sin    and      death    He    saves   us     And    light - ens     ev  - ’ry    load.    
verse      O      Sav     - ior,    child   of       Mar   - y,    Who    felt      our    hu    - man    woe,      O      Sav     - ior,   King   of      glo   - ry,    Who   dost   our    weak  - ness   know,    Bring   us      at      length,   we     pray,     To     the    bright   courts   of    Heav  - en     And    to      the     end - less   day.
