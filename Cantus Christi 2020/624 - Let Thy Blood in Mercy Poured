verse      Let    Thy     blood    in     mer     - cy      poured,   Let     Thy   gra   - cious   bod    - y     bro  - ken     Be     to     me,    O     gra    - cious   Lord,   Of       Thy   bound   - less   love   the    to   - ken;   Thou   didst   give   Thy - self   for   me;   Now   I   give   my - self   to   Thee.   
verse      Thou   didst   die      that   I         might   live;     Bless - ed    Lord,   Thou    cam’st   to    save   me.     All    that   love   of    God      could   give,   Je     - sus   by        His    sor  - rows   gave   me.    Thou   didst   give   Thy - self   for   me;   Now   I   give   my - self   to   Thee.   
verse      By     the     thorns   that   crowned   Thy     brow,     By      the   spear   wound   and      the   nail - ing;    By     the    pain   and   death,   I       now     Claim,   O     Christ,   Thy    love   un   - fail - ing.   Thou   didst   give   Thy - self   for   me;   Now   I   give   my - self   to   Thee.   
verse      Wilt   Thou    own      the    gift      I       bring?    All     my    pen   - i     - tence    I     give   Thee.   Thou   art    my     ex  - alt    - ed      King;   Of       Thy   match   - less   love   for  - give   me.    Thou   didst   give   Thy - self   for   me;   Now   I   give   my - self   to   Thee.
