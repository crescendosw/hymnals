verse      In    God,    my     faith   - ful    God,    I      trust   when   dark    my     road;   Though   man    - y       woes      o’er - take    me,   Yet    He      will    not      for   - sake    me.    His    love    it     is       doth    send     them    And,   when   ’tis   best,    will   end     them.   
verse      My    sins    as   - sail      me     sore,   But    I       de   - spair   no     more.   I        trust    in      Christ,   who    loves   me;   From   this    rock    noth   - ing     moves   me.    To     Him     I      all      sur   - ren    - der,    To     Him,   my     soul’s   de   - fend  - er.     
verse      If    death   my     por     - tion   be,     Then   death   is     gain    to     me      And      Christ   my      life      for  - ev    - er,   From   whom    death   can    - not     sev   - er.    Come   when    it     may,     He’ll   shield   me,     To     Him    I      whol   - ly     yield   me.     
verse      O     Je    - sus    Christ,   my     Lord,   So     kind    in     deed    and    word,   Thou     once     didst   die       to     save    us    Be   - cause   Thy     love     would   have    us     Be     heirs   of     Heav’n - ly      glad   - ness    When   ends   this   life     of     sad   - ness.   
verse      “So   be      it,”   then      I      say     With   all     my     heart   each   day.    Guide    us       while   here      we     wan   - der   Un   - til     we      praise   Thee    yon   - der.   We,    too,    dear   Lord,    a     - dore     Thee,   We     sing   for    joy      be   - fore    Thee.
