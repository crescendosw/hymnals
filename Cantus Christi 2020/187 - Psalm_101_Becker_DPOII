verse      I’ll   sing    of     lov - ing   - kind  - ness    And     raise   a     judg - ment   song;    O     LORD,   I    will   sing   prais - es      To   You    who     make   me   strong.   I’ll   wise - ly     play    an    up    - right   part.   Oh,   when    will   You    come    near   me?    I’ll   walk      with    per   - fect    heart.    
verse      I’ll   gaze    at     no  - thing   worth - less,   But     turn    a   - way    my     eye.     I     hate    a  - pos  - tate   busi  - ness;   I    will   not     make   it   mine.     I      will   not    be      per - verse   with  - in,     But   drive   a      vile   heart   from   me;    I      will      not     stud  - y       sin.      
verse      The    fur   - tive   gos - sip   - mong  - er,     I’ll    ban   - ish   from   the    land.    The   eye     de - mand - ing    hon   - or—     I    will   not     let    it   stand.    My     eyes   seek   out     the   faith - ful     ones,   To    pop   - u    - late   my      king - dom;   The    up      - right   serve   my      throne.   
verse      No     false   or     i   - dle     work  - ers,    Shall   oc    - cu  - py     my     house;   The   sight   of   ly   - ing    talk  - ers,    My   eye    shall   not    al - low.      I’ll   soon   de   - stroy   the   wick  - ed      man,    And   cut     off    e    - vil   - do   - ers;   I’ll   cleanse   Je    - ho    - vah’s   land.
