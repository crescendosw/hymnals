verse      If      thou    but     suf   - fer    God     to    guide   thee,   And     hope    in    Him     through   all     thy   ways,    He’ll   give    thee   strength,   what   - e’er   be     - tide    thee,   And    bear   thee    through   the    e    - vil    days.    Who    trusts   in      God’s   un   - chang - ing   love      Builds   on     the    rock     that   naught   can   move.     
verse      What    can     these   anx   - ious   cares   a   - vail    thee—   These   nev   - er  - ceas  - ing       moans   and   sighs?   What    can     it     help,       if       thou   be     - wail    thee,   O’er   each   dark    mo      - ment   as     it     flies?   Our    cross    and     tri   - als    do      but   press     The      heav - ier    for      our    bit    - ter - ness.     
verse      On    - ly      be      still   and    wait    His   lei   - sure    In      cheer - ful   hope,   with      heart   con - tent     To      take    what - e’er        thy      Fa   - ther’s   pleas - ure     And    all  - dis   - cern    - ing    love   have   sent;    Nor    doubt    thine   in    - most   wants   are   known     To       Him    who    chose    thee   for      His   own.      
verse      All     are     a     - like    be   - fore    the   high  - est;    ’Tis    eas   - y     to      our       God,    we    know,    To      raise   thee   up,         though   low    thou     li    - est,    To     make   the     rich      man    poor   and    low.     True   won    - ders    still   by     Him     are   wrought   Who      set  - teth   up       and    brings   to    naught.   
verse      Sing,   pray,   and     keep    His    ways    un    swerv   ing;    In      all     thy   la    - bor       faith - ful   be,      And     trust   His    Word;       though   un   - de     - serv  - ing,    Thou   yet    shalt   find      it     true   for    thee:    God    nev    - er      will    for  - sake    in    need      The      soul   that   trusts   in     Him      in  - deed.
