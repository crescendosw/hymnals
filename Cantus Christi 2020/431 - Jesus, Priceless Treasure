verse      Je     - sus,    price  - less   Treas - ure,    Source   of      pur   - est   pleas - ure,    Tru   - est    friend   to     me.       Ah,      how    long    in    an   - guish   Shall    my     spir    - it    lan  - guish,   Yearn - ing,   Lord,   for    Thee?    Thine   I       am,     O        spot  - less   Lamb;    I       will     suf   - fer    naught   to    hide    Thee,   Naught   I      ask     be   - side    Thee.   
verse      In       Thine   arms     I      rest    me;     Foes     who     would   mo  - lest    me      Can   - not    reach    me     here.     Though   the    earth   be    shak - ing,    Ev     - ’ry    heart     be    quak - ing,     Je    - sus    calms   my     fear.    Light - nings   flash   and      thun  - ders   crash,   Yet,    though   sin     and    Hell     as  - sail    me:     Je     - sus    will    not    fail    me.     
verse      Sa     - tan,    I        de   - fy      thee.   Death,   I       now     de  - cry     thee.   Fear,   I      bid      thee   cease.    World,   thou   shalt   not   harm   me      Nor      thy    threats   a   - larm   me       While   I      sing    of     peace.   God’s   great   pow’r   guards   ev    - ’ry    hour;    Earth   and      all     its    depths   a   - dore    Him,    Si     - lent   bow     be   - fore    Him.    
verse      E      - vil     world,   I      leave   thee.   Thou     shalt   not     de  - ceive   me;     Thine   ap   - peal     is     vain.     Sin      that   once    did   bind   me,     Get      thee   far       be  - hind   me,      Come    not    forth   a    - gain.    Past    thy     hour,   O        pride   and    pow’r,   Sin   - ful      life,   thy    bonds    I     sev   - er;     Leave    thee   now     for  - ev    - er.     
verse      Hence,   all     earth  - ly     treas - ure!    Je     - sus     is      my    pleas - ure;    Je    - sus,   all      my     choice.   Hence,   thou   emp   - ty    glo  - ry!     What     to     me        thy   sto  - ry       Told    with   tempt - ing    voice?   Pain    or      loss    or       shame   or     cross    Shall   not      from    my     Sav    - ior   move    me      Since    He     chose   to     love    me.     
verse      Hence,   all     fear     and    sad   - ness!   For      the     Lord    of    glad  - ness,   Je    - sus,   en     - ters   in.       Those    who    love    the   Fa   - ther,   Though   the    storms    may   gath - er,      Still   have   peace   with - in.      Yea,    what  - e’er    we       here    must   bear,    Still   in       Thee    lies   pur    - est   pleas - ure,    Je     - sus,   price - less   Treas - ure!
