To     us     no      harm     shall   now     come   nigh,    The   strife   at     last    is     end  - ed.   God    show  - eth    His     good - will      to       men,      And    peace   shall   reign   on      earth   a   - gain;    O      thank   Him   for     His    good - ness!

Thy    bound - less   pow’r   o’er   all       things   reigns;   Done   is      what  - e’er    Thy     will    or  - dains.   Well   for     us    that    Thou   rul  - est!

verse      Glo  - ry    be      to     God      the   Fa    - ther,   Glo    - ry    be      to     God      the    Son,     Glo  - ry    be     to    God      the   Spir   - it,      Great    Je  - ho     - vah,   Three   in     One!      Glo  - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry    While   e   - ter  - nal    a    - ges   run!      
verse      Glo  - ry    be      to     Him      who   loved   us,     Washed   us    from    each   spot     and    stain!   Glo  - ry    be     to    Him      who   bought   us,      Made     us    kings    with   Him     to     reign!    Glo  - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry    To      the   Lamb   that   once   was   slain!    
verse      Glo  - ry    to      the    King     of    an    - gels,   Glo    - ry    to      the    church - ’s     King,    Glo  - ry    to     the   King     of    na     - tions!

verse      “Glo - ry,   bless - ing,   praise   e   - ter   - nal!”   Thus     the   choir   of     an     - gels   sings;   “Hon - or,   rich - es,   pow’r,   do  - min    - ion!”    Thus     its   praise   cre  - a     - tion   brings;   “Glo - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry,   glo - ry,   Glo   - ry    to     the    King   of    kings!”
