verse      Broad   is     the   road    that   leads   to    death,    And   thou  - sands   walk    to   - geth  - er    there;   But     wis  - dom    shows    a       nar   - row   path,    With    here    and     there   a       trav   - el   - er.     
verse      “De   - ny     thy - self;   take   up      thy   cross,”   Is    our     Re    - deem  - er’s   great   com - mand;    Na    - ture   must   count    her     gold    but   dross,   If      she     would   gain    this    Heav’n - ly     land.   
verse      The     fear - ful   soul    that   tires   and   faints,   And   walks   the     ways    of     God     no    more,    Is      but    es   - teemed   al    - most    a     saint,   And     makes   his     own     de    - struc  - tion   sure.   
verse      Lord,   let    not   all     my     hopes   be    vain      Cre - ate     my      heart   en   - tire  - ly    new;     Which   hy   - po   - crites   could   ne’er   at  - tain,    Which   false   a     - pos   - tates   nev    - er     knew.
