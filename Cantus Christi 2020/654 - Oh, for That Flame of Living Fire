verse      Oh,     for    that   flame    of     liv   - ing     fire,   Which   shone     so         bright    in    saints   of    old!     Which    bade   their    souls    to      Heav’n   as   - pire,     Calm   in         dis  - tress,   in      dan  - ger     bold.   
verse      Where   is     that   Spir   - it,    Lord,   which   dwelt   In      A       - brah’m’s   breast,   and   sealed   him   Thine?   Which    made   Paul’s   heart    with    sor    - row    melt,     And    glow       with   en     - er    - gy     di    - vine?   
verse      That    Spir - it     which,   from   age     to      age,    Pro   - claimed   Thy        love,     and   taught   Thy   ways?    Bright - ened   I      - sa     - iah’s   viv    - id     page,     And    breathed   in     Da     - vid’s   hal  - lowed   lays?   
verse      Is      not    Thy    grace    as     might - y       now     As      when      E        - li      - jah   felt     its   pow’r;   When     glo  - ry       beamed   from    Mo     - ses’   brow,     Or     Job        en   - dured    the     try  - ing     hour?   
verse      Re    - mem  - ber,   Lord,    the    an    - cient   days;   Re    - new       Thy        work;     Thy   grace    re  - store;   Warm     our    cold     hearts   to      pray’r   and    praise,   And    teach      us     how      to      love   Thee    more.
