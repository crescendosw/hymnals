verse      God     the    Lord     is    known   in      Ju    - dah;    Great   His    name    in     Is      - ra   - el;      His     pa    - vil     - ion    is      in     Sa    - lem;    His       a   - bode    on     Zi      - on’s   hill.    There   He       broke   the    bow     and     ar     - rows,   Made    the     sword   and    shield   be    still.   
verse      Ex    - cel  - lent     art   Thou    and     glo   - rious   Com   - ing    from    the    hills     of     prey.    Thou    hast    spoiled   the    val   - iant - heart - ed;     Wrapped   in    sleep   of     death     are    they.    Might - y        men     have   lost    their   cun    - ning;   None    are     read  - y      for      the   fray.    
verse      Horse   and    char   - iot   low     are     ly    - ing     In      the    sleep   of     death’s   dark   night.   Ja    - cob’s   God,      Thou   didst   re   - buke    them;   Thou      art   fear  - ful    in        Thy    might.   When    Thine    an    - ger    once    is      ris    - en,     Who     may     stand   be   - fore     Thy   sight?   
verse      When    from   Heav’n   Thy   sen   - tence   sound - ed,     All     the    earth   in     fear      was    still,   While   to      save      the    meek    and    low   - ly      God       in    judg  - ment   wrought   His    will.    Ev’n    the      wrath   of     man     shall   praise   Thee;   What    re    - mains   will   come     to    nil.     
verse      Make    your   vows     now   to      Je    - ho    - vah;    Pay     your   God     what   is        His    own,     All     men,    bring     your   gifts   be   - fore    Him;    Fear      is    due     to     Him       a    - lone,    He      brings   low     the    pride   of      princ  - es;     Kings   shall   trem  - ble    at       His   frown.
