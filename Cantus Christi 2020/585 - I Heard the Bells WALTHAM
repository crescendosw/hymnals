verse      I      heard     the    bells   on     Christ - mas   day     Their    old     fa    - mil    - iar    car     - ols   play,    And    wild     and     sweet     the   words   re  - peat,   Of     peace   on   earth,   good   will   to   men.    
verse      I      thought   how,   as      the    day      had   come,   The      bel   - fries   of       all    Christ  - en  - dom      Had    rolled   a     - long      un  - bro   - ken   song    Of     peace   on   earth,   good   will   to   men.    
verse      And    in        de   - spair   I      bowed    my    head;   “There   is      no      peace    on     earth,”   I     said,    “For   hate     is      strong,   and   mocks   the   song    Of     peace   on   earth,   good   will   to   men.”   
verse      Then   pealed    the    bells   more   loud     and   deep:   “God     is      not     dead,    nor    doth      He    sleep;   The    wrong    shall   fail,     the   right   pre - vail,   With   peace   on   earth,   good   will   to   men.”   
verse      Till   ring    - ing,   sing  - ing    on       its   way,    The      world   re    - volved   from   night     to    day,     A      voice,   a       chime,    a     chant   sub - lime,   Of     peace   on   earth,   good   will   to   men.
