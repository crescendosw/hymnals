verse      I       will   bless    the    LORD      at    all     times   And     my     lips   will   al   - ways    praise.   In       the    LORD    my     soul   is     boast - ing;   Let     the   poor     their   an    - thems   raise.   Glo  - ri    - fy      the     LORD   to  - geth  - er     And    ex   - alt     His    name   with    me.     When     I     sought   Him,   how     He     an   - swered!   How     from   fear    He      set     me      free!   
verse      Those   who    look     to     Him       are   ra    - diant   And     they   nev  - er     bow    in      shame.    God      will   save    the    one    af   - flict - ed     When    he    calls    up    - on      the     name.    And    the     an    - gel     of     the   LORD    will   Come   t’en - cir   - cle    and    pro   - tect.   Taste    and   see      how    good    the    LORD   is—       Blest   are    all     our     God’s   e     - lect.   
verse      Fear    the    LORD,    you    saints,   and   wor   - ship.   Those   who    fear   Him    no   - thing   lack.     Li     - ons    may     grow   weak   and    hun   - gry    But     the   saints   bring   bless - ing     back.    Come   my      chil  - dren,   come   and   hear    me,    I      will   teach   you:   Fear   the     LORD!   If       you   love     your   life,   then   list - en,       List  - en     to      His     ho    - ly      Word.   
verse      Keep    your   tongue   from   speak   - ing   e     - vil,    Keep    your   lips   from   tell - ing     lies.     Turn     from   e     - vil,   turn   from   dan   - ger—   Those   who   seek     God’s   peace   are     wise.    For    God’s   eyes    are     on     the   right - eous   And    His    ears    will   hear   their   plea.   But      He    turns    from   e     - vil  - do   - ers       To      de   - stroy   their   mem   - o     - ry.     
verse      GOD     will   save     the    bro     - ken - heart - ed.     He      will   hear   us     when   we      cry.      Though   the    right - eous   may    have   trou  - ble,   GOD     de  - liv    - ers     from    on      high.    All    His     bones   will    be     pro - tec   - ted;   Not    one    bone    will   bro  - ken     be.     Though   He    slays    all    those   in     e    - vil       He      will   set     His     ser   - vants   free.
