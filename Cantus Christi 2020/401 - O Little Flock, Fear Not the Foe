verse      O    lit  - tle    flock,   fear   not     the   foe       Who     mad   - ly      seeks   your    o     - ver   - throw;    Dread   not      his   rage    and   pow’r.   What     though   your   cour     age    some   times   faints,   His   seem  - ing    tri   - umph   o’er   God’s   saints    Lasts   but    a      lit  - tle   hour.   
verse      Be   of     good   cheer;   your   cause   be  - longs     To      Him     who     can     a     - venge   your    wrongs;   Leave   it       to    Him,    our   Lord.    Though   hid    - den    yet      from   mor  - tal     eyes,     His   Gid   - eon    shall   for    you    a     - rise,     Up    - hold   you    and    His   Word.   
verse      As   true   as     God’s    own    Word    is    true,     Not     earth   nor     Hell    with    all     their   crew      A     - gainst   us    shall   pre - vail.    A        jest     and    by     - word   are    they    grown;    God   is      with   us,     we     are    His     own;      Our     vic  - t’ry   can  - not   fail.   
verse      A  - men,   Lord   Je     - sus,   grant   our   pray’r;   Great   Cap     tain,   now     Thine   arm     make    bare,     Fight   for      us    once    a   - gain!    So       shall    Thy    saints   and    mar  - tyrs    raise     A     might - y      cho   - rus    to     Thy     praise,   World   with - out    end.   A   - men.
