Wait  - ing   aid,      with    ear   - nest   eye    - ing,   Call    - ing    God    with    use     - less   cry  - ing:   Dim     and     dry      in       me      are     found     Eye     to    see,     and     throat   to       sound.   
verse      Wrong - ly      set     to    work    my    woe,     Hat    - ers   have   I,      more    than   hairs:    Force   in      my      af    - flict - ing     foe       Bet  - t’ring   still,    in     me      im   - pairs.   Thus    to    pay       and     lose    con  - strain - ed     What      I      nev  - er      owed      or     gain - ed,    Yet     say     I,       “Thou,   God     dost    know      How     my    faults   and     fol    - lies     go.”     
verse      Might - y       Lord,   let   not     my    case     Blight   the   rest   that    hope    on     Thee:     Let     not     Ja    - cob’s   God     de    - face      All    his      friends   in     blush   of     me.

verse      If      I       weep,   and   weep  - ing   fast,    If       in    sack - cloth   sad     I      mourn,    In      my      teeth   the     first   they    cast,     All    to       jest      the    last    they   turn.    Now     in    streets   with    pub   - lic    prat   - ing    Pour    - ing    out    their   in      - ward   hat  - ing:   Pri   - vate    now      at       ban   - quets   placed,   Sing  - ing   songs    of      win    - y        taste.   
verse      As      for     me      to    Thee    I     pray,    LORD,    in    time   of      grace   as   - signed:   Gra   - cious   God,    my      kind  - est     stay,     In     my       aid       be     tru   - ly     kind.    Keep    me    safe      from    such,   and    mir    - ed,    Safe      from   flow - ing     foes      re   - tir  - ed:    Calm    these   waves,   these    wa    - ters    bay,      Leave   me    not      this    whirl  - pool’s   prey.
