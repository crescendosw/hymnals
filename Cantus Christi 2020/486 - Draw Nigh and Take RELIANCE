Saved   by      that   bod    - y      and      that    ho    - ly     blood,     With   souls   re  - freshed,   we     ren    - der   thanks   to    God.

Of    - fered   was    He       for    great  - est     and     for    least,     Him  - self    the   vic      - tim,   and      Him - self     the   priest.   
verse      Vic  - tims     were     of    - fered   by        the   law      of    old,     That   in      a      type    ce    - les   - tial   mys    - t’ries   told.     He,     Ran   - som  - er       from   death,   and     Light   from   shade,     Now    gives   His   ho       - ly     grace,   His   saints   to    aid.      
verse      Ap   - proach   ye       then    with    faith   - ful   hearts   sin - cere,    And    take    the    safe  - guard   of      sal  - va     - tion     here.

verse      With   Heav’n - ly       bread   and     wine      to    make     us    whole,   Give   liv   - ing    wa    - ters    to      the    thirst - ing      soul.     O       Judge   of     all,     our    on     - ly      Sav   - ior    Thou,      In     this    Thy   feast      of     love     be    with     us    now.
