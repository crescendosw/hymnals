verse      O       LORD,   make   haste       to    hear   my    cry,     To     Thee   I    call,   on     Thee    re  - ly.     In   - cline   to    me       a      gra   - cious   ear,    And     when   I     call,     in      mer  - cy    hear.    O         right  - eous   God,    Thy    chas - tise  - ment,      Though   sent   through   foes,   in      love     is      sent;   Though   griev - ous,   it      will   prof - it     me;      A     heal - ing   oint  - ment    it      shall     be.      
verse      When    in      the    morn      - ing   un   - to    Thee     I      lift   my   voice   and    bring   my    plea,   Then   let     my    pray’r   as     in    - cense   rise    To      God    en  - throned   a     - bove   the   skies.   While     wick   - ed   - ness    my     foes   de    - vise,      To       Thee   my        con   - stant   pray’r   shall   rise;   When     their   in   - jus   - tice   is     o’er - thrown   My    gen  - tle - ness    shall   still   be        shown.   
verse      When    un    - to     Thee        I     look   and   pray     With   lift - ed   hands   at     close   of    day,    Then   as      the   eve    - ning   sac   - ri    - fice    Let     my     re  - quest     ac    - cept - ed    rise.    Brought   nigh     to     death   and    sore   dis   - tressed,   O        GOD    the       Lord,   in      Thee     I       rest;   For    - sake    me     not,    I      look   to     Thee,    Let   me     Thy   great   sal   - va    - tion      see.     
verse      Guard   Thou    my     thoughts,   I     Thee   im  - plore,   And    of     my   lips,   keep   Thou    the   door;   Nor    leave   my    sin    - ful    heart   to      stray   Where   e    - vil   foot    - steps   lead   the   way.     Them    - selves   en   - tan   - gled   in     their   snare,     Their    own    de      - feat    my      foes     pre   - pare;   O        keep    me,    Lord,   nor    let    me     fall,    Pro - tect   and   lead    me      safe    through   all.
