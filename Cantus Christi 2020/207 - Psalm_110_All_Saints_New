verse      Je  - ho   - vah   to    my      Lord   has     said,   “Sit      Thou    at      My     right   hand     Un  - til     I     make    Thy     foes   a       stool    Where - on      Thy     feet   may     stand.”   Je - ho  - vah   shall    from    Zi   - on    send    The     scep  - ter    of     Thy   pow’r.   In     bat   - tle    with    Thine   en   - e   - mies    Be    Thou     the    con - quer - or.     
verse      A     will - ing   peo - ple     in     Thy     day     Of        pow’r   shall   come   to      Thee.    Thy   youth   ar  - rayed   in      ho   - li    - ness     Like    morn  - ing     dew    shall   be.       Je - ho  - vah   swore,   and     from   His   oath    He      nev   - er     will   de  - part:    “Of    th’or - der    of      Mel   - chiz - e   - dek     A     priest   Thou   ev  - er     art.”   
verse      The   Lord   at    Thy   right   hand   shall   smite   Earth’s   rul   - ers     in     His     wrath.   A   - mong    the   na    - tions   He     shall   judge;   The     slain   shall   fill   His     path.     In   man - y     lands    He’ll   o    - ver - throw   Their   kings   with   ru   - in    dread;   And,   march - ing,   He’ll   drink   from   the   brook   And   so       lift   up    His    head.
