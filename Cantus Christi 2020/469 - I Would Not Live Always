verse      I       would    not     live   al - ways:   I      ask   not     to    stay    Where   storm   af   - ter    storm   ris    - es      dark    oâ€™er   the    way;     The     few     lu    - cid   morn  - ings   that   dawn      on     us       here      Are   fol   - lowed   by       gloom   or     be   - cloud - ed    by     care.     
verse      I       would    not     live   al - ways,   thus   fet - tered   by    sin;    Temp  - ta    - tion   with - out,    and      cor   - rup   - tion   with - in:      Where   rap   - ture    of    par   - don    is     min     - gled   with     fears,    The   cup     of      thanks - giv   - ing    with   pen   - i   - tent   tears.    
verse      I       would    not     live   al - ways;   no,    wel - come    the   tomb:   Since   Je    - sus    hath   lain    there,   I       dread   not    its    gloom;   There   sweet   be      my    rest,   till   He     bid       me     a      - rise      To    hail    Him     in       tri   - umph   de   - scend - ing   the    skies.    
verse      And     who      would   live   al - ways,   a    - way   from    his   God;    A     - way     from   yon    Heav  - en,      that    bliss - ful    a    - bode?    Where   riv   - ers     of    plea  - sure   flow   through   the    bright   plains,   And   noon  - tide    of       glo   - ry     e    - ter   - nal - ly     reigns;   
verse      There   saints   of      all    ag - es      in     har - mo    - ny    meet,   Their   Sav   - ior    and    breth - ren,     trans - port  - ed,    to     greet:   While   an    - thems   of    rap   - ture   un   - ceas    - ing  - ly       roll,     The   smile   of      the      Lord    is     the    feast   of    the    soul.
