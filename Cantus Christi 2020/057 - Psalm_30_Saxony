verse      I      will   ex  - tol     Thee,   Lord,    on     high,    At    Thy    com - mand    dis - eas    - es     fly;    Who      but     our    God      can   speak   and   save     From    the    dark   bor  - ders   of       the   grave!   
verse      Sing   to     the   Lord,   ye      saints   of     His,     And   tell   how   large   His   good   - ness   is.     Let      all     your   pow’rs   re  - joice   and   bless,   While   you    re   - cord   His    ho     - li  - ness.    
verse      His    an   - ger   but     a       mo     - ment   stays;   His   love   is    life    and   length   of     days;   Though   grief   and    tears    the   night   em  - ploy,    The     morn - ing  - star   re   - stores   the   joy.     
verse      Firm    was       my    health,   my      day       was   bright,   And     I        pre    sumed   ’twould   ne’er   be    night;   Fond - ly       I       said    with    - in      my    heart,    “Pleas - ure      and      peace     shall   ne’er   de    - part.”    
verse      But     I         for - got       Thine   arm       was   strong,   Which   made     my     moun  - tain      stand   so    long:    Soon   as       Thy     face    be      - gan     to    hide,     My       health   was      gone,     my      com   - forts   died.     
verse      I       cried     a   - loud      to      Thee,     my    God,      “What   canst    Thou   prof  - it        by      my    blood?   Deep   in       the     dust    can       I       de  - clare     Thy      truth,   or       sing      Thy     good  - ness    there?    
verse      “Hear   me,       O     God       of      grace,”   I     said,     “And    bring    me     from    a       - mong    the   dead.”   Thy    word     re    - buked   the       pains   I     felt,     Thy      par    - d’ning   love      re    - moved   my      guilt.    
verse      My      groans,   and   tears,    and     forms     of    woe,      Are     turned   to     joy     and       prais - es    now;     I      throw    my      sack  - cloth     on      the   ground,   And      ease     and      glad    - ness    gird    me      ’round.   
verse      My      tongue,   the   glo     - ry      of        my    frame,    Shall   ne’er    be     si    - lent      of      Thy   name;    Thy    praise   shall   sound   through   earth   and   heav’n,   For      sick   - ness     healed,   and     sins    for   - giv’n.
