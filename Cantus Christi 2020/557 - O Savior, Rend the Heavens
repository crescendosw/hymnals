verse      O       Fa     - ther,   dew    from    heav  - en    send;   As       gen   - tle    dew,    O      Son,    de  - scend.    Drop    down,    you     clouds,   and    tor   - rents   bring;   To     Ja  - cob’s   line   rain   down   a      King.    
verse      O       earth,   in      flow - ’ring   bud     be    seen;   Clothe   hill    and    dale    in     garb    of    green.    O       earth,   bring   forth     this   Blos  - som     rare;    O      Sav - ior,    rise   from   mead - ow     fair.    
verse      Here    dread  - ful     doom   up    - on      us    lies;   Death    looms   too    grim    be   - fore    our   eyes.     O       come,    lead    us        with   might - y       hand     From   ex  - ile     to     our    fa   - ther - land.    
verse      There   will     we      all    our     prais - es    bring   Ev     - er      to     Thee,   our    Sav   - ior   King;     There   will     we      laud      Thee   and     a     - dore     For    ev  - er      and    for    ev   - er   - more.
