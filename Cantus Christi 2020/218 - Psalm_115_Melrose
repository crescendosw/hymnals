verse      Not   un    - to     us,     LORD,    not     to      us—     To       Your    name    be      the    praise,   Be  - cause     Your   love      and     faith - ful - ness    En    - dure,   O     LORD,   al    - ways.     
verse      Why   do      the    na    - tions    ques  - tion    us?     “Where   is      their   God?”   they   say.      Our   God       in   - hab     - its     heav  - en    high    And     o     - ver   all     holds   sway.     
verse      The   LORD    who    has     re     - mem   - bered   us      His      bless - ing     will    be   - stow;     All   those     who    fear      His     ho    - ly    name,   His     lov   - ing   care    shall   know.     
verse      For   small   and    great   who      fear    His     name    The      Lord    has     good    in     store;    Ye    and       your   chil    - dren,   blest   of    God,    Shall   pros  - per   more    and     more.     
verse      The   great   Cre  - a     - tor      bless - es      you     With     gifts   of      bound - less   worth;    The   heav’ns   He     claims,   but     gives   to    man     Do    - min   - ion   in      the     earth.    
verse      The   si    - lent   dead    praise   not     the     LORD,   The      grave   no      song    can    raise;    But   we        will   bless     Him     ev    - er  - more,   Let     all     pro - claim   His     praise.
