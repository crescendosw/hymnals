verse      If     God    is     on       our    side,   a      - gainst   us     shall    be    none.   He     did    not     spare    His    own,      His      well - be    - lov    - ed       Son,      But     gave      Him   up       for   us,     that   He     might   save    us    tru    - ly.     Will   He     with   Him    not   give      us      all    things   free   and    ful - ly?    Who     then   will   yet   ac    - cuse      those   whom    He     has    e   - lect - ed?     ’Tis      God       who   just  - i     - fies     in    Christ,   the   Res   - ur   - rect - ed.      
verse      None   will   con  - demn     us     now!    Christ   Je     - sus,   He       who   died—   Yes,   rath - er,     who      was    raised—   sits     at     His     Fa     - ther’s   side      And     in      - ter - cedes    for   us;     He     will   for   - sake    us    nev    - er.     Who    from   the    love   of    Christ    shall   sep  - a      - rate   us     ev  - er?    Shall   per  - se   - cu  - tion,   shall     dis   - tress   or     trib - u   - la   - tion,   Or        nak     - ed  - ness,   or      sword,   or    per     - il,   or      star - va   - tion?    
verse      ’Tis   writ - ten,   “For     Your   sake    they     kill     us     all      day   long;   We     are    con   - sid    - ered   sheep     by       hat  - ers     fierce   and      strong;   We’re   be      - ing   put      to    death   and    driv - en      to      the   slaugh - ter.”   All    day    we     are    dis - graced;   we      are    poured   out    like   wa  - ter.   But     yet    in     all   these   things    we      are     more   than   vic - to   - rious   Through   Him       who   loved   His     own,     our   Sav     - ior   great   and    glo  - rious.   
verse      I      am     con  - vinced   that   nei   - ther     pow    - ers,   death,   nor   life,   Nor    an   - gels,   things   to     come,     things   pre  - sent,   prin   - ces,     strife,   Nor     height,   nor   depth,   nor   an    - y      oth  - er      thing   cre - a      - ted     Will   from   the    love   of    God       now     keep   us       sep  - a    - rat - ed—    His     love   in     Je  - sus     Christ,   the     Sav   - ior    whom   He    gave   us,     That      through   His   pre   - cious   blood    He    might     re  - deem    and    save   us.
