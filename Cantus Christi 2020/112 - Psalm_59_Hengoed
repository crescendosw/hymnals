verse      O      God,    de   - liv   - er     me!      En   - e     - mies   en   - cir    - cle;    De   - fend   from   those    who   hat  - ed     me,       Save   me     from    in    - iq    - ui   - ty,      Since   my      blood   they   want    to      see,       See,    they   all     lie   in      wait    for     my   soul.       But   You,    O       LORD,   will   laugh,    Have   them   in     de   - ri   - sion.   In     all    Your   strength   I      wait   on     You.     For     You    are    my     for   - tress   true     And     Your      mer     - cy    shall   come   through.   God   shall   let    me     see    to    - vic - to    - ry.         
verse      The    might - y      gath  - ered   here,    They   will    come   a    - gainst   me.     Not    for    the    faults   I     have   ab   - horred,   Not    for    all     my      sins,   O      LORD.    But     their   spite   is     ven   - om      stored,    Come,   O      Lord,   and   de    - liv   - er      me   now.        O     Lord,   do      not     slay   them,     Lest   all    men    for  - get    You.    Scat - ter    them   by         Your   awe  - some   pow’r;   Bring   them   down   with - in      an      hour,    Guard - ian       Shield,   O     make    them   cow’r,     And   let     them   all    be     tak   - in    their   pride.      
verse      You,   O       LORD   God     of     hosts,   The    great   God    of     Is     - rael,   A    - wake   to     vis    - it    hea  - then   tribes.   And    no     mer   - cy      be      as   - cribed   To      what    God’s   law    sin     de    - scribes.   So      a    - rise,   and   show    forth   might - y    strength.   For   all     their   ly    - ing    mouths,   And    for    ly   - ing    curs - es,     Con  - sume   them   in         Your   ho   - ly     wrath,   Get     them   to     a      great   blood - bath,    And     through   all       its   af    - ter  - math,      Let   them    know   that   God    rules   all   the     earth.      
verse      They   cir   - cle    round   at     night,   And    they    howl   like   mad      dogs.   They   go     a    - round    the   cit  - y      walls.    And    with   howls   their   ha    - tred   mauls,   Their   sword   for     our    blood   still   calls,     For     they   say     in    their   pride   hears   us   now?”       So    they    come    back    at     night;    As     wild   dogs   they   scav - enge.   Let    them   roam   up         and    down   for    meat.    But     I      sing   of     mer   - cy      sweet;   And     their     fi      - nal   great   de   - feat,      I     will    sing   of     Your   mer   - cy    and     strength.
