verse      A     - bide   with   me—     fast   falls   the      e    - ven - tide:    The       dark    - ness   deep    - ens;   Lord,   with   me      a    - bide.    When       oth  - er        help   - ers      fail      and    com   - forts   flee,   Help      of      the    help   - less,    O       a - bide   with   me.   
verse      Swift   to     its    close   ebbs   out     life’s   lit  - tle   day;     Earth’s   joys      grow   dim,      its    glo   - ries   pass    a    - way.     Change     and    de      - cay      in       all       a    - round   I       see.    O         Thou    who    chang  - est      not,    a - bide   with   me.   
verse      I       need   Thy    pres  - ence   ev    - ’ry      pass - ing   hour;    What      but       Thy    grace     can    foil    the    tempt - er’s   pow’r?   Who        like   Thy     - self     my       guide     and    stay    can     be?     Through   cloud   and    sun    - shine,   O       a - bide   with   me.   
verse      I       fear   no     foe     with   Thee    at       hand   to    bless:   Ills      have      no     weight,   and    tears   no     bit   - ter  - ness.    Where      is     death’s   sting?   Where,   grave,    thy    vic   - to    - ry?     I         tri   - umph   still,   if       Thou    a - bide   with   me.   
verse      Hold    Thou   Thy    cross   be   - fore    my       clos - ing   eyes.    Shine     through   the    gloom     and    point   me     to      the    skies.   Heav’n’s   morn - ing       breaks   and      earth’s   vain   shad  - ows     flee;   In        life,   in     death,   O        Lord,   a - bide   with   me.
