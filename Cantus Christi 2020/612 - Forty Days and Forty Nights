verse      Sun   - beams   scorch - ing    all     the   day;     Chil  - ly     dew    - drops   night  - ly      shed;    Prowl - ing   beasts   a     - bout    Thy    way;     Stones   Thy    pil    - low,   earth   Thy   bed.     
verse      Shall   we      not      Thy    sor   - row   view,    And     with   hearts   at    - tuned    to      Thine,   Yield - ing   up       our     wills   a    - new,     Share    with   Thee     a      food    di  - vine?    
verse      And     if      Sa     - tan,   vex   - ing   sore,    Flesh   or     spir   - it      should   as    - sail,    Thou,   his   Van    - quish - er      be   - fore,    Grant    we     may      not    faint   nor   fall.    
verse      So      shall   we       have   peace   di  - vine:    Ho    - lier   glad   - ness    ours     shall   be;      Round   us,   too,     shall   an    - gels   shine,   Such     as     min    - is   - tered   to    Thee.
