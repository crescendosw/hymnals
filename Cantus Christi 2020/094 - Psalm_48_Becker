verse      Great   is      the    LORD!    His    praise   is      great.      God’s   love  - ly     ci   - ty,    raised   in      state,   Gives   joy      to       all     the    earth    In     Zi    - on’s   courts   the    great    King     dwells:   The    re     - fuge   of      her       ci   - ta   - dels.    
verse      Lo,     kings   as   - sem    - bled   to       sur   - vey.        Trou  - bled,   they   saw    and    ran      a     - way      A     - larmed   by       pain    and    fear,    As     wom   - en     cry      in     birth  - ing      pains,    As     ships    You    break   with      hur  - ri   - canes.   
verse      We      heard   re   - ports    of     God’s    great   strength.   So      we      have   seen   in     Zi     - on’s    length   He      is       the      LORD    of     hosts!   Be   - cause   God    builds   with   His      strong   hand      Je   - ru     - sa   - lem     will      al   - ways   stand.   
verse      God,    we      re   - called   Your   ten    - der     grace,      While   meet  - ing    in     Your   ho     - ly      place.   Ac    - cord   - ing      to      Your   name;    Your   rul   - ing    hand     in     praise   earth    sees.     Your   saints   re   - joice   for       Your   de   - crees.   
verse      Walk    Zi    - on’s   lim    - its;   count    her     tow’rs,     Note    her     de   - fens - es;    see      their   pow’r:   Your    off    - spring   needs   to     know.    Our    God     is     God!     In     all      our      path,     He     guides   our    way     through   life   and    death.
