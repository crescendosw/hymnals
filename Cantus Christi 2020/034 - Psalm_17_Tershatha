verse      Lord,   I        am      Thine;   but    Thou    wilt   prove    My      faith,   my       pa    - tience,   and     my     love:    When   men     of     spite    a    - gainst   me      join,    They   are     the   sword,   the     hand    is      Thine.   
verse      Their   hope     and     por    - tion   lie     be   - low;     ’Tis    all      the      hap   - pi      - ness    they   know,    ’Tis   all     they   seek;    they   take     their   shares   And    leave   the   rest     a     - mong    their   heirs.   
verse      What    sin    - ners    val    - ue,    I       re   - sign;    Lord,   ’tis     e      - nough   that      Thou    art    mine;    I      shall   be   - hold     Thy    bliss  - ful     face     And    stand   com - plete    in      right - eous  - ness.    
verse      This    life’s   a       dream,   an     emp   - ty     show,    But     the      bright   world   to        which   I      go       Hath   joys    sub  - stan   - tial   and      sin   - cere;    When   shall   I     wake,    and     find    me      there?   
verse      O       glo    - rious   hour!    O      blest   a    - bode!    I       shall    be       near    and       like    my     God,     And    flesh   and    sin      no     more     con   - trol     The    sac   - red   pleas  - ures    of      the     soul.    
verse      My      flesh    shall   slum   - ber    in      the    ground   Till    the      last     trum  - pet’s     joy   - ful    sound,   Then   burst   the    chains   with   sweet    sur   - prise,   And    in      my    Sav    - ior’s   im    - age     rise.
