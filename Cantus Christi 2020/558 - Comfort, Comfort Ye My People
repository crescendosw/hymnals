verse      Com  - fort,   com      - fort    ye      my     peo   - ple,   Speak   ye     peace,   thus   saith   our   God;     Com - fort   those    who   sit      in    dark - ness,   Bowed   be  - neath   their   sor - row’s   load.    Speak   ye     to     Je    - ru  - sa  - lem    Of    the    peace    that   waits    for   them;    Tell   her    that     her     sins   I     cov  - er,    And    her   war   - fare   now      is    o     - ver.    
verse      Yea,   her     sins       our     God     will   par   - don,   Blot  - ting   out      each   dark    mis - deed;    All   that   well     de  - served   His   an   - ger     He      no    more    will    see   nor     heed.    She     has    suf  - fered   man - a     day;   Now   her    griefs   have   passed   a   - way.     God    will   change   her     pin  - ing   sad  - ness   In   - to    ev    - er   - spring - ing   glad  - ness.   
verse      For    the     her      - ald’s   voice   is     cry   - ing    In      the    des    - ert    far     and   near,    Bid - ding   all      men   to       re  - pen  - tance   Since   the   king  - dom     now   is      here.    Oh,     that   warn - ing     cry   o   - bey!   Now   pre  - pare     for    God      a     way!     Let    the    val    - leys    rise   to    meet   Him,   And    the   hills   bow    down     to    greet   Him.    
verse      Make   ye      straight   what    long    was    crook - ed,    Make    the    rough  - er     plac  - es    plain.   Let   your   hearts   be    true     and   hum  - ble,    As      be  - fits    His     ho  - ly      reign.   For     the    glo  - ry      of    the   Lord   Now   o’er   earth    is     shed     a   - broad;   And    all    flesh    shall   see    the   to   - ken    That   His   word    is     nev    - er    bro   - ken.
