verse      I     wait - ed     for     the    LORD;   He     stooped   and    heard   my    cry.     He      brought   me     from     the   pit,       Out    of      the   dun    - geon    mire,    My    feet   set      on     a         rock,    My     foot - steps   made    se    - cure.   My       lips    He      gave    a       song,   A       song   to    praise   our   God.       
verse      Man - y      will   see     with   awe,    And    so        will   trust   the   LORD.    Blest   he        who    trusts   in    GOD        And    turns   not   to       false   men.     You   have   worked   won  - ders,     LORD;    No     one    com   - pares   to      You!    Should   I       de    - clare   each    one,    Their   num  - ber   is       too   great.     
verse      You   want   no     of    - fer  - ing,    Nor    ask       a      sac   - ri  - fice,    But     You       have   giv    - en    me         A      read  - y     ear      to      hear.    You   ask    no       of   - f’rings   burnt,   Nor    sac  - ri    - fice    for     sin.    So       I       say,    "Here   I       come,   As      in     the   scroll   in  - scribed.   
verse      “To   do     Your   will,   O      God,    To     me        is     my      de  - light.   Your    law       is     part     of    me,        Deep   in      my    heart,   O       God.”    In    con  - gre    - ga   - tion      great    I      told   Your    right - eous  - ness.   You      know,   LORD,   I       spoke   out,    I       did    not   close    my    lips.      
verse      I     hid    not    in      my     heart   Your   truth     and    sav   - ing   help;    Your    faith   - ful  - ness     I     preached   In     con   - gre - ga     - tion    great.   Do    not    with   - hold   from      me       Your   ten  - der     mer   - cies,   LORD    Let      Your    un    - fail  - ing     love    For     ev   - er    keep     me    safe.
