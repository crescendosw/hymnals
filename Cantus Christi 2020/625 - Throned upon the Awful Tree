verse      Throned   up     - on        the     aw    - ful     tree,    King   of      grief,    I     watch   with   Thee.     Dark  - ness   veils   Thine    an   - guished   face;   None    its     lines   of      woe     can    trace,   None    can     tell    what   pangs   un  - known   Hold   Thee   si    - lent   and    a    - lone.   
verse      Si      - lent     through   those   three   dread   hours,   Wres - tling   with      the   e     - vil    pow’rs,   Left    a    - lone    with     hu   - man       sin,    Gloom   a     - round   Thee    and     with - in,      Till    th’ap - point - ed     time    is    nigh,   Till   the    Lamb    of     God    may    die.    
verse      Hark!     the      cry       that    peals   a     - loud     Up   - ward    through   the   whelm - ing    cloud!    Thou,   the    Fa    - ther’s   on   - ly        Son,    Thou,   His     own     a     - noint - ed     One,     Thou    dost    ask     Him—   can     it    be?—    “Why   hast   Thou    for  - sak  - en     Me?”    
verse      Lord,     should   fear      and     an    - guish   roll     Dark - ly      o’er      my    sin   - ful    soul,     Thou,   who    once    was      thus   be      - reft    That    Thine   own     might   ne’er   be     left,    Teach   me      by      that   bit   - ter   cry     In     the    gloom   to     know   Thee   nigh.
