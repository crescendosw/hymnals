verse      Well   may    Thy    ser  - vants   mourn,   my    God,      The     church - ’s      des    - o   - la     - tion;   The     state   of     Zi   - on      calls    a  - loud      For    grief   and    la     - men  - ta     - tion;   Once   she     was      all      a     - live    to    Thee,   And    thou - sands   were   con   - vert  - ed;    But   now      a      sad    re      - verse    we    see—    Her   glo - ry   is       de - part - ed.   
verse      Her    pas  - tors   love   to      live     at    ease;     They    co     - vet     wealth   and   hon    - or;     And     while   they   seek   such    things   as   these,    They   bring   re   - proach   up   - on       her.    Such   worth - less     ob     - jects   they    pur - sue,    Warm - ly     and     un   - di    - vert  - ed,    The   church   they   lead   and       ru     - in,   too:    Her   glo - ry   is       de - part - ed.   
verse      Her    pub  - lic    mem  - bers    walk     no    more      As      Je     - sus     Christ   has   taught   them;   Rich  - es      and    fash - ion     they     a  - dore:     With   these   the    world    has    bought   them.   The    Chris - tian’s   name     they    still   re  - tain    Ab   - surd - ly      and    false   heart - ed;    And   while    they   in     the       church   re  - main,   Her   glo - ry   is       de - part - ed.   
verse      And    has    re   - li   - gion    left     the   church,   With  - out      a       trace    be  - hind     her?    Where   shall   I      go,    where   shall    I    search,   That   I       once   more     may    find     her?    A    - dieu!   ye       proud,   ye      light   and   gay!    I’ll   seek   the     bro  - ken   - heart - ed,    Who   weep,    when   they   of        Zi     - on    say,    Her   glo - ry   is       de - part - ed.   
verse      Some   few,   like   good   E     - li     - jah   stand,    While   thou   - sands   have     re  - volt   - ed;     In      ear   - nest   for    the     Heav’n - ly   land,     They   ne    - ver    yet      have   halt   - ed.     With   such,   re     - li     - gion    doth    re  - main,   For    they   are     not    per   - ver   - ted;   Oh!   may      they   all    through   them     re  - gain,   The   glo - ry   that’s   de - part - ed.
