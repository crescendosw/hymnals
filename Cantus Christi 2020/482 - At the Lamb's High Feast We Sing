verse      Where   the    Pas    - chal    blood   is     poured,   Death’s   dark   an   - gel   sheathes   his     sword;   Is    - rael’s   hosts    tri - um   - phant   go       Through   the    wave      that   drowns   the   foe.     Christ,   the   Lamb   whose   blood   was    shed,     Pas   - chal      vic - tim,   Pas   - chal   bread;   With    sin  - cer   - i   - ty       and   love     Eat      we     man    - na     from     a   - bove.     
verse      Might - y      vic    - tim     from    the    sky,      Pow’rs    of     Hell   be  - neath      Thee    lie;     Death   is       bro    - ken   in     the     fight;   Thou      hast   brought   us     life     and   light.   Now       Thy   ban  - ner     Thou    dost   wave;     Van   - quished   Sa  - tan    and     the    grave:   An    - gels   join    His   praise   to    tell,    See      o’er - thrown   the    prince   of    Hell.

Hymns     of    glo  - ry,     songs   of     praise,   Fa    - ther,     un  - to     Thee    we     raise;   Ris   - en     Lord,   all   praise   to    Thee,    Ev     - er     with     the    Spir   - it    be.
