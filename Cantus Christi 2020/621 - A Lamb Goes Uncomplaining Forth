Goes   pa     - tient   on,     grows   weak   and    faint,     To     slaugh - ter    led    with    - out       com   - plaint,   That   spot  - less    life     to    of    - fer;    Bears   shame    and   stripes   and     wounds   and      death,     An   - guish,   and   mock   - er    - y,      and    saith,    “Will - ing     all     this     I       suf  - fer.”    
verse      This    Lamb    is      Christ,   the    soul’s   great   Friend   And    ev    - er   - last - ing     Sav   - ior;    Him    God     the   Fa    - ther   chose   to      send     To      gain   for     us     His   fa    - vor.    “Go    forth,   my      Son!”   the     Fa   - ther   saith,     “And   free     men    from   the       fear      of      death     From   guilt   and     con    - dem - na    - tion.   The     wrath    and   stripes   are     hard     to       bear,      But    by       Thy   Pas    - sion,   men     will   share     The     fruit   of      Thy      sal   - va   - tion.”   
verse      “Yea,   Fa    - ther,   yea,      most   will   - ing   - ly       I’ll   bear    what   Thou   com   - mand  - est;    My     will    con - forms   to     Thy     de    - cree,    I       do     what    Thou   de  - mand  - est.”   O      won    - drous   Love!   What    hast   Thou   done!      The    Fa     - ther   of   - fers      up        His     Son,      The    Son,    con   - tent,    de  - scend - eth!    O       Love!    how   strong    art     Thou     to       save!      Thou   lay’st   Him   low      with  - in      the    grave     Whose   word    the     moun     tains   rend - eth!     
verse      Lord,   all     my      life      I’ll   cleave   to      Thee,    Thy    love    for  - e’er   be    - hold  - ing,    Thee   ev    - er,   as      Thou   ev    - er      me,      With    lov  - ing     arms   en  - fold  - ing.    Yea,   Thou     shalt   be      my      Bea  - con  - light,     To     guide    me     safe   through   death’s   dark    night,    And    cheer   my      heart    in    sor   - row;    Hence - forth    my  - self,     and     all      that’s   mine,      To     Thee,    my    Sav    - ior,    I       con  - sign,     From    whom    all     things   I       bor  - row.     
verse      From    morn    and     eve       my     theme    shall   be       Thy    mer   - cy’s   won  - drous   mea   - sure;   To     sac   - ri  - fice    my   - self    to      Thee,    Shall   be     my      aim    and   pleas - ure.    My     stream   of      life    shall   ev   - er     be         A      cur    - rent   flow - ing       cease   - less  - ly        Thy    con   - stant   praise   out - pour  - ing.    I’ll    treas  - ure   in        my      mem    - o      - ry         O      Lord,    all   Thou     hast    done    for    me        Thy     gra   - cious   love     a     - dor  - ing.     
verse      Of      death   I       am        no     more     a     - fraid,   New    life    from   Thee   is      flow  - ing;    Thy    cross   af  - fords   me     cool  - ing     shade    When    noon - day’s   sun    is    glow  - ing.    When   by       my      grief   I       am     op   - pressed,   On     Thee     my     wea  - ry        soul      shall   rest      Se   - rene  - ly      as       on    pil   - lows.   Thou    art      my    an      - chor,   when     by       woe        My     bark     is    driv   - en      to      and    fro       On      trou  - ble’s   surg   - ing     bil  - lows.    
verse      And     when    Thy     glo     - ry     I        shall   see      And    taste   Thy    king - dom’s   pleas - ure,    Thy    blood   my    roy   - al     robe    shall   be,      My      joy    be    - yond   all   mea   - sure.   When   I        ap    - pear    be    - fore   Thy    throne     Thy    right  - eous - ness   shall     be        my      crown—    With   these   I       need     not   hide    me.     And     there,   in    gar     - ments   rich   - ly       wrought,   As     Thine    own   bride,   I       shall   be     brought   To      stand   in      joy      be    - side   Thee.
