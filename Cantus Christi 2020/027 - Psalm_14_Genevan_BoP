verse      The    fool   says    in     his    heart,   “There   is       no      God.”     They   are      cor  - rupt,   their   hor    - rid    deeds   they   cher  - ish;    Not    one    of      them   does    good,   and     just   men   per   - ish.    None   calls   up  - on       the   LORD,   none   sings   His    laud      Or        fears   His     rod.     
verse      The    LORD   looks   down   from   heav   - en’s     ho     - ly      throne    To     see      if     there   are     an     - y      that    act    wise  - ly.     O      God,   not     one    seeks   Thee;   they    all    de  - spise   Thee:   See    how     the   sons     of    men,    to     e     - vil    prone,    Thy       law     dis   - own.     
verse      Will   e    - vil   - do   - ers    ne     - ver      un     - der   - stand?    As     though   they   ate     their   bread,   so     those   who    hate    Thee    Eat    up     my      help - less    peo   - ple,    who    a   - wait    Thee.   They   do      not   pray,    but   e     - vil    they    have   planned   Through - out     the     land.    
verse      See    how    they    trem - ble,   how      they     cringe   with    fear,     For    God      is     with    the     just     in     love    un   - bound - ed.     They   wish   to      see    the     poor    man’s   hope   con - found - ed,     But    when    he    cries,   how - ev    - er     loud    they   jeer,     The       LORD    shall   hear.    
verse      O      Is   - ra    - el,    you    peo    - ple      of       God’s   choice,   That   out      of     Zi    - on      might    come   your    sal  - va    - tion!   When   from   their   bon  - dage    God     shall   free   His   na    - tion,   Let    Ja    - cob   sing     and   Is    - ra   - el      re   - joice     With      hap   - py      voice.
