verse      The     spa   - cious   heav’ns   de  - clare    God’s     glo   - ry     ev   - ’ry  - where;   The   skies   pro  - claim      His   might.   The     know - ledge   they    dis  - play    Day     ech   - oes   forth   to     day     And     night    makes   known   to    night.   They    use     no      speech   or    word,   Yet    ev     - ’ry  - where    is    heard    The   voice    of      all     cre - a      - tion.   The    truth     that   it      ex    - pounds    Through - out     the      world   re    - sounds   And   reach - es     ev     - ’ry    na    - tion.   
verse      God     in      the     firm    - a   - ment     Pitched   for     the    sun    a      tent,    The   can   - o    - py         of    night.   It’s    like   a       joy   - ful    groom   Who     from    his   bri   - dal    room    Leaps   forth    with    great   de  - light.   Like    one     who     runs     a     race    With   strong   and    eag    - er    pace,    It    speeds   a     - cross   the   heav   - ens;    The    sun       its    path    com   - pletes,   And       from    its      pier  - cing    heat     Not   an    - y    - thing    is     hid   - den.    
verse      God’s   law     is      sound     and   whole;   It        will    re   - vive   the    soul,    For   it      new    strength   sup - plies.   His     test - i     - mo    - ny     sure,   Trust - worth - y     ev    - er   - more,   Will    make     the     sim   - ple   wise.    His     pre   - cepts   plain  - ly    show    How    right    they   are,     and   so       The   heart    they    cheer   and   bright - en.     The    LORD’s    com  - mand  - ments   pure      Shine     forth   with     rad   - iance   clear    And   so      the    eyes     en   - light - en.     
verse      The     fear    of      God       is    clean    And,      free    from   sin    and    stain,   For - ev    - er     will       en  - dure.    His     judg - ments   all     ex   - press   Un    - fail  - ing   right - eous - ness;   The     LORD’s   de    - crees   are   sure.    They    far     ex    - ceed     in    worth   The    fin    - est    gold     on    earth:   His   pre    - cious   test  - i   - mo     - ny!     They   e       - ven    sweet - er      are       Than      all     that’s   sweet   and     pure     In    combs   that   drip     with   hon   - ey.     
verse      Your    ser   - vant,   who       has   heard    The       warn  - ings   of     Your   Word,    To    them    pays   heed,      O     LORD.    Those   walk - ing     in      Your   way,    Who     Your    com - mands   o    - bey,    Will    reap     a       great   re  - ward.    But,    LORD,   who     can      per - ceive   What   er     - rors   one      may   have     Un  - wit    - ting  - ly      com - mit    - ted?    Oh,    cleanse   me!    Let     me      be        Of        sec   - ret      fail  - ings    free,    Of    hid   - den    faults   ac   - quit  - ted.    
verse      O       LORD,   from    will    - ful   ways     Pre     - serve   me     all    my     days:    The   rule    of     sin        pre - vent.    Then    I      shall   blame - less   be,     From    grave   of  - fen   - ses    free,   And     whol   - ly      in    - no  - cent.    LORD,   hear    me      as       I     pray:   Let    what     my     tongue   may   say      And   what     my      heart   may   pon    - der     Be     pleas   - ing    in      Your    sight,    Re      - deem  - er       great   in      might,   My    rock    and    my       de   - fend  - er.
