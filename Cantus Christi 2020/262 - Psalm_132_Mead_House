LORD,   re  - mem  - ber    his     de    - vo   - tion;   Rest - less   in      his   courts   he     trod     Till    he    found     a       hab     - i    - ta    - tion    Fit     for     Is  - rael’s   might  - y       God.      
verse      Far     a     - way     God’s   ark     was   rest - ing;   It     is     with   His    peo   - ple     now;    We      will   go      in  - to      His    tem   - ple,   At       His    foot   - stool   we       will    bow.     With    the   ark    Thy    might   re    - veal - ing,    En   - ter,   LORD,   in  - to       Thy    rest;    Let     Thy   priest    be      clothed   with   jus   - tice,   Let     Thy     joy - ful      saints   be      blest.    
verse      Let     the     king    be    - hold    Thy   fa   - vor    For    Thy    ser  - vant   Da    - vid’s   sake,   Un    - to     whom    a     sa    - cred   prom  - ise,   Sure     and    faith  - ful,    Thou     didst   make.

verse      Thou,   the     LORD,   hast    cho   - sen   Zi   - on,    Thou   hast   ev   - er     loved   her     well;   “This   My     rest  - ing - place   for  - ev    - er;    Here,”   Thou   sayst,   “I      choose   to      dwell.   Sure  - ly    I      will   bless   and     help   her,    Feed   her    poor,   her   saints   make   glad,    And     her   priests   shall   stand     be   - fore    Me      In      sal   - va  - tion’s   gar    - ments   clad.
