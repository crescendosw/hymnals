verse      But    You     have   cast      us      off,     O        God,      And    us      You’ve   put      to     shame;   And      when    our    ar    - mies   rise    to      fight,    You    go      not      forth   with      them.    You   make    us      from   the   en     - e    - my,         Faint - heart - ed,     to      turn   back;    And     they    that   hate     us,     for     them  - selves   Our       right - ful    spoils   take.     
verse      You    ren   - der    us        as      sheep    for      meat;     Cast   to      the      hea    - then   foe.     Your     cho   - sen    ones    You    sold    for     nought;   Your   in    - crease   did     not       grow.    You   make    us      a      re  - proach   in     mind        Un    - to      our     neigh - bors   near;    De    - ri    - sion   and      a       scorn   to      them     That      round   a    - bout     pear.     
verse      On     hea   - then   tongues   our     name     has      been      A      by    - word     of     - ten    said;    The      peo   - ple,   in      con  - tempt   and     spite,    Look   on      and      shake   the       head.    Be  - fore    me      my     per - plex   - i    - ty          Con   - tin   - ual   - ly      I      see;     The     shame   of     my       grim    coun  - te    - nance    Now       o     - ver  - shad   - me,       
verse      The    voice   of     him       that    speaks   re     - proach,   Of   - fends   with     blas   - phem - y;       Be     - cause   of     the     a    - veng  - ing     foe,      And    cru   - el       en    - e       - my.      All   this    has     come   on    us       yet    we          Have    not     for   - got   - ten    You;     Nor     false - ly     in       Your    cov   - ’nant   dealt,   Your      test  - i    - mo     - true.     
verse      Back   from    Your   way       our     heart    turned   not;      Our    steps   no       stray  - ing    made;    Though   us      You    break   in     dra   - gon’s   place,    And    cov   - er       with    death’s   shade.   If    we      God’s   name   for - got,     or     stretched   To      for   - eign    gods    our    hands,   Shall   not     God    search   this    out?    for     He       Heart’s   sec   - rets   un     - stands.   
verse      Yes,   for     Your   sake      we’re   killed   all      day,      And    count - ed       slaugh - ter  - sheep.   Rise,    Lord!   Cast   not     us     ev    - er      off,      A    - wake!   Why      do      You       sleep?   O     where - fore    do     You   hide     Your   face?       Af    - flic  - tions   You     for  - get,     And     our     op   - pres   - sion?   For     our     soul     To        dust    bows   in       gret.
