verse      I     love    the    LORD,    the    fount   of     life    and      grace;   He     heard   my        voice,   my     cry     and      sup   - pli - ca   - tion,    In    - clined   His     ear,    gave   strength   and     con   - so   - la   - tion;    In     life,   in     death,   my    heart    will   seek    His     face.     I      have    be  - lieved,   and     there - fore    did      I      speak    When   I        was      made    to      suf   - fer   trib - u    - la  - tion;    I      said     in     haste    and    bit - ter   con    - ster - na  - tion:    “All   men     are    false;   de  - ceit  - ful     ways     they   seek.”   
verse      The   cords   of     death    held   me      in     deep    de     - spair;   The    ter   - rors      of       the    grave   caused   me      to    lan  - guish;   I       suf    - fered   un    - told   grief      and     bit   - ter    an   - guish;   In     my      dis  - tress    I     turned   to     God     in      pray’r.   What   shall   I     ren     - der     to      my      Sav    - ior    now      For    all      the      rich  - es      of      His   con  - so   - la  - tion?    With   joy      I’ll   take     the    cup   of    His      sal  - va  - tion,    And    call    up   - on       His   name    with    thank  - ful    vow.     
verse      I     cried   to     Him,     “Oh,   I       be   - seech   Thee,    LORD,    Pre  - serve   my        life     and    prove   Thy    - self    my    Sav  - ior!”    The     LORD     is      just    and    He         shows   grace   and    fa   - vor;     In     bound - less   mer    - cy    He       ful  - fills   His     word.     In     all     His   peo     - ple’s   pres  - ence    I        will   pay      My     vows     to       Him,    the     LORD    so    good   and    gra - cious.   To     God      the    death    of     all   His   saints   is     pre - cious;   In     times   of     grief    He    is      their   help     and    stay.    
verse      The   LORD    pre  - serves   the    help  - less   gra   - cious  - ly;      For,   when    brought   low,     in     Him     I        found   sal - va   - tion.    Come,   O        my      soul,   re   - lieved     from    trib  - u    - la   - tion,    Turn   to      your   rest;    the   LORD     has    fa    - vored   me.       I      am,     O     LORD,     Thy     ser   - vant,   bound    yet    free,    Thy    hand   - maid’s   son,    whose   shack - les   Thou   hast   bro - ken.     Re   - deemed   by     grace,   I’ll   ren - der   as       a      to  - ken      Of     grat  - i    - tude     my    con   - stant   praise   to     Thee.    
verse      O     right - eous   LORD,    Thou   in      Thy    sov   - ’reign   grace    Hast   saved   my        soul     from   death   and      woe     ap  - pall - ing,     Dried   all      my      tears   and    kept       my      feet    from   fall - ing,     That   I       may    live     and   walk     be   - fore    Thy     face.     Je   - ru    - sa  - lem!      With  - in      your    courts   I’ll   praise   The    LORD’s   great    name,   and     with    a     spir - it     low - ly       Pay    all      my     vows.    O      Zi  - on,   fair     and    ho  - ly,      Come   join    with   me       and   bless   Him     all      your   days!
