verse      What - e’er   my   God   or - dains   is   right:   His      ho    - ly     will    a  - bid   - eth;   I        will    be     still   what - e’er    He      doth     And   fol  - low   where   He    guid   - eth.   He   is      my       God;    Though   dark    my     road,    He      holds   me     that   I       shall    not   fall:    Where - fore   to      Him   I     leave   it    all.    
verse      What - e’er   my   God   or - dains   is   right:   He       nev   - er     will    de - ceive   me.    He       leads   me     by      the    prop  - er      path;    I     know   He    will    not   leave    me.    I    take,   con    - tent,   What     He      hath   sent;    His     hand    can    turn   my      griefs   a   - way,     And     pa   - tient - ly    I     wait    His   day.    
verse      What - e’er   my   God   or - dains   is   right:   Though   now     this   cup,    in   drink - ing,   May      bit   - ter    seem    to     my      faint   heart,   I     take   it,   all     un  - shrink - ing.   My   God     is       true;   Each     morn    a    - new      Sweet   com   - fort   yet    shall   fill     my    heart,   And     pain   and     sor - row   shall   de  - part.   
verse      What - e’er   my   God   or - dains   is   right:   Here     shall   my     stand   be   tak   - en;    Though   sor   - row,   need,   or     death   be      mine,    Yet   I      am    not     for - sak    - en.    My   Fa    - ther’s   care    Is       round   me     there;   He      holds   me     that   I       shall    not   fall,    And     so     to      Him   I     leave   it    all.
