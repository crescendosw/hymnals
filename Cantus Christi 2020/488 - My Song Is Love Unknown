verse      My     song    is     love     un    - known—   My     Sav   - ior’s   love    to      me,      Love   to      the    love     - less   shown   That   they     might   love   - ly      be.      Oh,     who     am    I,        That     for      my       sake      My     Lord     should   take      Frail   flesh     and     die?     
verse      He     came    from   His      blest   throne   Sal  - va    - tion    to      be    - stow,    But    men     made   strange,   and    none    The    longed - for     Christ   would   know.    But     oh,     my    friend,   My       friend   in     - deed,     Who    at       my       need      His     life      did     spend!   
verse      Some - times   they   strew    His     way      And    His     sweet   prais - es      sing;    Re   - sound - ing    all        the    day     Ho   - san    - nas     to       their   King.    Then    “Cru  - cu  - fy!”      Is       all      their    breath,   And    for      His      death     They    thirst    and     cry.     
verse      Why,   what    hath   my       Lord    done?    What   makes   this    rage    and     spite?   He     made    the    lame       to     run;    He     gave     the     blind    their   sight.   Sweet   in    - ju  - ries!     Yet      they     at       these     Them - selves   dis    - please,   And     ’gainst   Him     rise.    
verse      They   rise    and    needs    will    have     My     dear    Lord    made    a     - way.     A      mur   - der  - er         they   save;   The    Prince   of      Life     they    slay.    Yet     cheer - ful   He        To       suf    - f’ring   goes,     That   He       His      foes      From    thence    might   free.    
verse      In     life,   no     house,   no      home     My     Lord    on      earth   might   have;    In     death   no     friend   - ly     tomb    But    what     a       strang - er      gave.    What    may     I     say?      Heav’n   was      His      home;     But    mine     the      tomb      Where - in        He      lay.     
verse      Here   might   I      stay     and     sing—    No     sto   - ry      so      di    - vine!    Nev  - er      was    love,      dear   King,   Nev  - er       was     grief    like    Thine.   This    is      my    friend,   In       whose    sweet    praise    I      all      my       days      Could   glad    - ly      spend!
