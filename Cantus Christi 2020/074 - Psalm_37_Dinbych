verse      When   e     - vil    peo   - ple    sin     And    wrong   sup   - press - es      right,     Re     - mem   - ber,   they    will   fade    a      - way       And     with  - er     o     - ver   - night.    Com - mit     your   way     to     God;     Trust   Him       to     bless   the   right.    He    gives   you   all    your   heart’s   de    - sire      When    He      is     your    de  - light.    
verse      Be     still   be   - fore    the    LORD,   Wait   pa    - tient - ly      for     Him,       And      do      not    fret    when   wick  - ed     - ness      Suc   - ceeds   to     make    life    grim.     Re  - frain   from   an    - gry    ways     And     wor     - ries   that    de  - stroy.    All   those   who   look   to     God       their   LORD      His     king  - dom    shall   en  - joy.      
verse      The    wick  - ed     fight   the    poor,   But    God     will    scorn   their   stealth.   The      lit   - tle    that    the    right - eous     hold      Is      bet   - ter    than    sin’s   wealth.   The   LORD    up   - holds   His    own;     Their   bless   - ings   will    in  - crease.   But   all     the   wick - ed     come      to      naught—   Their   pow’r   will   sure  - ly    cease.    
verse      The    god   - less   bor   - row    much    And    then    do      not     pay     back.      The      right - eous   give    and    give    a      - gain—     Their   chil  - dren   have    no      lack.     My    steps   are    from    the    LORD,    Who     helps     my     feet    to    stand.    I     stum  - ble   but    I      do        not     fall:     God     holds   me     with    His   hand.     
verse      Shun   e     - vil    and     do     good;   Then   you     will    live    in      peace.     The      LORD    pro  - tects   His    suf   - f’ring   saints,   But     wick  - ed     lives   will    cease.    The   right - eous   speak   the    truth,   Their   tongues   with   wis   - dom   flow;     The   law     of    God    is     in        their   heart.    He      saves   them   from    the   foe.      
verse      The    LORD    will   bless   your   land    If     you     but     keep    His     way.       Though   wick  - ed     peo   - ple    grow    like     trees,    They    soon    will   pass    a     - way.      Sal - va    - tion   comes   from   God      Who     saves     us     from    the   wrong,    And   those   who   seek   His    shel    - ter     find      A       ref   - uge    safe    and   strong.
