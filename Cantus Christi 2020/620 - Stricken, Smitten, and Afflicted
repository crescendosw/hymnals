verse      Strick - en,   smit  - ten,   and    af   - flict - ed,     See    Him     dy   - ing   on      the    tree!    ’Tis       the       Christ,   by    man     re   - ject  - ed;     Yes,   my    soul,   ’tis   He,     ’tis   He!      ’Tis   the   long  - ex   - pect   - ed     Pro   - phet,   Da   - vid’s   Son,    yet   Da   - vid’s   Lord.    By     His     Son     God   now      has    spok    - en;   ’Tis   the   true     and     faith - ful    Word.    
verse      Tell     me,   ye      who    hear   Him    groan - ing,    Was    there   ev   - er    grief   like   His?     Friends,   through   fear,     His   cause   dis  - own   - ing,    Foes   in  - sult  - ing    His     dis  - tress.   Man  - y     hands   were   raised   to     wound   Him;    None   would   in    - ter - pose   to      save;    But    the     deep  - est   stroke   that   pierced   Him   Was    the   stroke   that    Jus   - tice   gave.    
verse      Ye       who   think   of     sin    but    light - ly      Nor    sup   - pose   the   e     - vil    great,   Here       may       view      its   na    - ture   right - ly,     Here   its   guilt   may    es    - ti   - mate.    Mark   the   sac   - ri   - fice     ap   - point - ed,     See    who     bears   the   aw   - ful     load;    ’Tis   the     Word,   the   Lord’s   A    - noint   - ed,   Son    of    Man      and     Son     of     God.     
verse      Here     we    have    a      firm   foun - da    - tion,   Here   the     ref  - uge   of      the    lost:    Christ’s   the       rock      of    our     sal  - va    - tion,   His    the   name    of     which   we     boast.   Lamb   of    God,    for    sin    - ners   wound - ed,     Sac  - ri    - fice    to    can  - cel     guilt!   None   shall   ev    - er    be       con  - found   - ed    Who    on    Him      their   hope    have   built.
