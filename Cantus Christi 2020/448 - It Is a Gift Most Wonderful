verse      It    is     a       gift    most   won  - der   - ful,     A     grace   that   I       can    scarce   be  - lieve,   That   God’s   own     Son      should   come      from   Heav’n,   And   die    to      save    a      child   like   me.      
verse      And   yet    I       know    that   it     is      true:    He    came    to     this    poor   world    be  - low,     And    wept    and     toiled   and      mourned   and    died,     On  - ly     be    - cause   He     loved   us     so.      
verse      I     can  - not     tell    how    He     could   love     A     child   so     weak    and    full     of    sin;     His    love    must    be       most     won     - der  - ful,      If    He     could   die     my     love    to     win.     
verse      I     some - times   think   a    - bout   His     cross,   And   shut    my     eyes,   and    try      to    see      The    cru   - el      nails    and      crown     of     thorns    And   Je   - sus     cru   - ci   - fied    for    me.      
verse      But   e    - ven     could   I      see    Him     die,     I     could   but    see     a      lit    - tle   part     Of     that    great   love,    which,   like      a      fire,     Is    al   - ways    burn  - ing    in      His    heart.   
verse      It    is     most    won   - der  - ful    to      know     His   love    for    me      so     free     and   sure;    But    ’tis    more    won    - der    - ful       to     see       My    love   for     Him     so     faint   and    poor.    
verse      And   yet    I       want    to     love   Thee,   Lord:    O     light   the    flame   with - in       my    heart,   And    I       will    love     Thee     more      and    more      Un  - til    I       see     Thee   as      Thou   art!
