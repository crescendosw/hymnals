verse      O       tell     of     His    might,   O      sing     of      His   grace,   Whose   robe       is     the   light,   whose   can    - o    - py    space.   His    char    - iots     of    wrath    the     deep     thun   - der   - clouds   form,    And    dark    is      His    path    on     the     wings   of     the    storm.    
verse      This    earth,   with   its    store    of     won    - ders    un  - told,    Al    - might    - y,     Thy   pow’r    hath    found  - ed     of    old,     Hath   stab    - lished   it    fast     by      a        change - less    de     - cree,    And    round   it      hath   cast,   like   a       man   - tle,   the    sea.      
verse      Thy     boun   - ti   - ful    care     what   tongue   can     re  - cite?    It      breathes   in     the   air,     it      shines   in     the   light,   It     streams   from     the   hills,   it      de     - scends   to      the      plain,   And    sweet - ly      dis  - tills   in     the     dew     and    the    rain.
