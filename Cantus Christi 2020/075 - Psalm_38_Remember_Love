verse      A     - midst      Thy    wrath,   re   - mem  - ber    love;    Re   - store   Thy     ser    - vant,   Lord,      Nor   let     a      Fa    - ther’s   chast - ’ning   prove    Like   an      a   - ven   - ger’s    sword.   All    my     de  - sire   to   Thee    is     known,   Thine   eye      counts   ev    - ’ry   tear;    And    ev    - ’ry     sigh    and   ev   - ’ry     groan,   Is     no   - ticed   by      Thine   ear.    
verse      Thine   ar       - rows   stick    with - in     my     heart,   My     flesh   is      sore   - ly      pressed;   Be  - tween   the    sor   - row      and     the     smart,   My     spir  - it    finds   no       rest.    Thou   art    my    God,   my   on    - ly     hope,    My      God      will     hear    my    cry;     My     God     will    bear    my    spir - it      up,      When   Sa   - tan     bids    me      die.    
verse      My      sins       a      heav   - y      load   ap   - pear,    And    o’er    my      head     are     gone;      Too   heav  - y      they    for      me      to      bear,    Too    hard    for   me      t’a    - tone.    My     foot   is    ev   - er   apt     to     slide,   My      foes     re     - joice   to    see’t;   They   raise   their   pleas - ure   and    their   pride    When   they   sup   - plant   my      feet.   
verse      My      thoughts   are    like     a      trou - bled   sea,     My     head    still   bend   - ing     down;      And   I       go     mourn - ing      all     the     day,     Be   - neath   my    Fa    - ther’s   frown.   But    I’ll   con - fess   my   guilt   to     Thee,    And     grieve   for      all     my    sin;     I’ll   mourn   how     weak    my    gra  - ces     are      And    beg    sup   - port    di    - vine.   
verse      Lord,   I          am     weak     and    bro  - ken    sore,    None   of      my      pow’rs   are     whole:     The   in    - ward   an    - guish    makes   me      roar,    My     a     - go  - ny      of       soul.    My     God,   for - give   my   fol   - lies   past,    And     be       for      ev    - er    nigh;    O      Lord    of      my      sal - va   - tion,   haste,   Be   - fore   Thy     ser   - vant    die.
