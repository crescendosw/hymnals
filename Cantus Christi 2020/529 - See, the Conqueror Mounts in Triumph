Lord    of      bat - tles,   God       of    arm  - ies,    He      hath   gained   the   vic    - to  - ry.      He      who   on        the    cross    did   suf     - fer,    He       who     from    the    grave   a   - rose,     He      hath   van   - quished   sin     and     Sat  - an;    He    by    death   hath    spoiled   His   foes.

verse      While   He     lifts    His      hands    in    bless - ing,    He     is    part   - ed     from    His     friends;   While   their   ea  - ger     eyes      be  - hold   Him,    He      up   - on       the   clouds   as  - cends.   He      who   walked    with   God      and   pleased   Him,    Preach - ing     truth   and    doom    to    come,     He,     our    E     - noch,     is      trans - lat  - ed     To    His   ev    - er    - last    - ing   home.
