verse      I        will    sing     my     Mak    - er’s   prais - es     And    in     Him     most     joy   - ful    be,      For   in     all     things   I       see     trac  - es      Of      His   ten    - der    love      to    me.      Noth  - ing    else       than   love    could   move    Him     With   such    sweet    and    ten   - der      care     Ev   - er     - more     to      raise      and   bear     All      who   try     to        serve   and   love   Him.    All    things   else   have    but    their   day;    God’s    great   love   a    - bides   for   aye.    
verse      Yea,     so      dear     did    He       es   - teem    me     That   His    Son     He       loved   so     well     He    hath   giv   - en       to      re    - deem    me      From    the   quench - less   flames    of    Hell.    O       Thou   Spring     of     bound - less    bless - ing,    How    could   e’er     my     fee   - ble      mind     Of     Thy      depth    the     bot      - tom   find     Though   my    ef    - forts     were    un  - ceas - ing?    All    things   else   have    but    their   day;    God’s    great   love   a    - bides   for   aye.    
verse      All      that    for      my     soul     is     need  - ful    He     with   lov   - ing      care    pro  - vides,   Nor   of     that    is       He      un    - heed  - ful     Which   my    bod    - y      needs     be  - sides.   When    my     strength   can  - not     a     - vail    me,     When   my      pow’rs   can    do      no       more,    Doth   my       God      His     strength   out - pour;    In       my    need    He        doth    not   fail   me.     All    things   else   have    but    their   day;    God’s    great   love   a    - bides   for   aye.    
verse      When     I       sleep,   He     still    is     near    me,    O’er   me     rests   His      guard - ian    eye;     And   new    gifts   and      bless - ings    cheer   me      When    the   morn   - ing    streaks   the   sky.     Were    it     not        for    God’s   pro   - tec   - tion,   Had    His     coun   - te   - nance   not      been     Here   my       guide,   I       had        not   seen     E’er     the   end     of        my      af  - flic - tion.   All    things   else   have    but    their   day;    God’s    great   love   a    - bides   for   aye.    
verse      As       a       fa     - ther   nev    - er     turn  - eth    Whol - ly     from    a        way   - ward   child,   For   the    prod  - i      - gal     still   yearn - eth,    Long  - ing   to       be     rec     - on  - ciled,   So      my     man      - y      sins    and     er    - rors    Find   a       ten    - der,   par   - d’ning   God,     Chas - t’ning   frail  - ty      with       His   rod,     Not,     in    ven   - geance,   with    His   ter  - rors.   All    things   else   have    but    their   day;    God’s    great   love   a    - bides   for   aye.    
verse      Since,   then,   neith  - er     change   nor    cold  - ness   In     my     Fa    - ther’s   love    can    be,      Lo!   I      lift    my       hands   with    bold  - ness;   As      Thy   child    I      come      to    Thee.    Grant   me     grace,     O      God,    I       pray    Thee,   That   I       may      with   all     my       might,   All    my       life   - time,   day        and   night,   Love     and   trust   Thee      and     o   - bey    Thee    And,   when     this   brief   life   is      o’er,   Praise   and     love   Thee   ev    - er  - more.
