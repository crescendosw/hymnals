verse      A       - maz   - ing    grace!   —how    sweet   the     sound—    That     saved   a     wretch   like    me;       I       once    was     lost,     but    now     am      found;   Was    blind,   but    now     I     see.      
verse      ’Twas     grace   that   taught   my      heart   to      fear,     And      grace   my    fears    re    - lieved;   How     pre   - cious   did       that   grace   ap    - pear     The    hour     I      first   be  - lieved!   
verse      Through   man   - y      dan    - gers,   toils   and     snares,   I        have    al  - read   - y       come;     ’Tis    grace   hath    brought   me     safe    thus    far,     And    grace    will   lead    me    home.     
verse      The       Lord    has    prom   - ised    good    to      me,       His      word    my    hope     se    - cures;    He      will    my      shield    and    por   - tion    be       As     long     as     life    en  - dures.    
verse      Yes,      when    this   heart    and     flesh   shall   fail,     And      mor   - tal   life     shall   cease,    I       shall   pos   - sess      with - in      the     veil,    A      life     of     joy     and   peace.    
verse      When      we’ve   been   there    ten     thou  - sand    years,    Bright   shin  - ing   as       the     sun,      We’ve   no      less    days      to     sing    God’s   praise   Than   when     we     first   be  - gun.
