verse      I         sing   the   might - y      pow’r    of    God     That   made     the   moun  - tains   rise;    That   spread   the   flow  - ing     seas   a     - broad,   And   built   the   loft    - y      skies.    I       sing   the    wis - dom    that   or   - dained   The    sun    to   rule   the   day;    The   moon   shines   full    at     His      com   mand,   And     all    the   stars   o    - bey.     
verse      I         sing   the   good  - ness   of       the   Lord,   That   filled   the   earth   with    food;    He     formed   the   crea  - tures   with   His     word,    And   then    pro   nounced   them   good.     Lord,   how    Thy    won - ders   are    dis  - played   Wher - e’er   I    turn   my    eye;    If    I      sur    - vey     the    ground   I     tread   Or      gaze   up  - on      the    sky!     
verse      There’s   not    a     plant   or     flow’r   be  - low,    But    makes    Thy   glo   - ries    known;   And    clouds   a     rise,   and     tem  - pests   blow     By    or    - der   from      Thy    throne;   While   all    that   bor - rows   life   from   Thee     Is     ev   - er   in     Thy   care,   And   ev   - ’ry    - where   that   man      can   be,     Thou,   God,   art   pre   - sent   there.
