verse      O     God      of      my    praise,   don’t   ig   - nore     me      in     si   - lence!   The   lies   of      the   wick   - ed     op  - pose   me     with   tor   - ments.   Their   tongues   have   at    - tacked   me     with   cruel   ac   - cu    - sa   - tion.   They’ve   cir  - cled   a   - round    me      with   words     of     re  - vul   - sion;   They’ve   turned   with - out    cause   and     be    - came      my     as    - sail - ants    Be  - tray - ing     my     love,   they’ve   be    - come     my      op   - pon - ents.   
verse      I     have     no      re  - sort      but     this   pray’r   to      my     Fa   - ther!    My    good   they    de  - spise    and    re  - ward   me     with   an    - ger,     My      love      they   de    - ride     with   a      hate  - ful    ag    - gres - sion.   So        give   him    a     king     that    will   rule      with   op  - pres  - sion,   And       let      ac   - cu   - sa    - tions   be      brought   by     his     ri   - val.    Con - demn   him     for    sin;    let       his     pray’r   be    - come   e   - vil.    
verse      Let   death    take    him   soon;     give    his    place    to      a    - noth - er.      His   chil - dren    a   - ban    - don,   a   - lone   with - out    fa    - ther,    His     wife      make   a       wi     - dow    with - out     a      pro   - tec  - tor.    Make      beg  - gars   and   tramps   of      his    son       and    his   daugh - ter     And       let      them   seek   bread   stray - ing     far       from   their   ho   - vels.   Let   cred - i     - tors   rob     him       de    - spite    how     he     gro - vels.   
verse      Let   strang - ers     ex  - tort      all     the    fruit    of      his    la   - bor.     Let   none   show    him   mer    - cy,    nor   act    as     his    neigh - bor;     Do      not       let    his     fa     - ther - less   sons    be     shown   pit  - y.      Cut       off    his    de  - scend  - ants;   ex   - pelled    from   the   cit   - y,      In        one      gen  - e    - ra    - tion    their   hon     - or     be      wast - ed:     Let   his  - t’ry    for  - get     that      he      ev     - er      ex   - ist - ed!     
verse      Re  - call     ev    - ’ry   e       - vil     his    fa     - thers   com  - mit  - ted,     See   none   of      the   crimes   of     his   moth - er     ac   - quit  - ted.     Ex    - pose      all    their   sin      to     Je   - ho    - vah    for   - ev   - er,     So        blot   from   the   earth    ev    - ’ry    thought   of     his   fa    - vor.    Be      - cause    he     for  - got     to      re    - lieve     the    for   - sak  - en,     But   tor  - tured   the    need  - y         and     slaugh - tered   the    bro - ken.    
verse      As    he       loved   to    curse,    o     - ver  - whelm    him     with   curs - ing;     As    he     would   not   bless,   let    him   nev  - er     find   bless - ing.     His     gar     - ment   was     curs   - ing    he     wore    with   ap    - prov - al,     So        make   it     his   belt     with    no     hope      of     re  - mov   - al.     Let       all      who    ma   - lign    me      have    this      con  - dem   - na   - tion;   Re  - ward   them    in     kind    for       their   false    ac    - cu   - sa  - tion.
