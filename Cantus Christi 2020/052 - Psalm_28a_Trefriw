verse      O       LORD,   my     Rock,   I       cry,     “Do      not    re    - main   in     si  - lence,   For    when    You     turn    Your    face    a     - way       Hell   swal  - lows    me       in   vi    - ’lence.”   
verse      The     day     I      lift    my      voice,   Please   hear   my      sup  - pli  - ca  - tion.    I      raise   my      hands   be    - fore    Your    throne,   Up     to      Your    ho     - ly   sta   - tion.      
verse      Do      not     drag   me      a     - way      With     men    who     prac - tice   e   - vil.     They   speak   peace   in      their   neigh - bors’   ears      But    in      their   hearts   is   trou  - ble.       
verse      Re    - pay     them   for     their   deeds    And      for    their   e    - vil    do  - ings.    Re   - turn    to      them    what    they    have    made,     And    bring   their   souls    to   ru    - in.        
verse      LORD,   they    de   - spise   Your    works    And      hate   Your    ho   - ly     act - ions,    But    You     will    tear    them    stone   from    stone     And    give    them    to       de - struc - tion.
