verse      God      is      our    ref   - uge     and       our     strength,   In       straits   a       pre  - sent   aid;    There - fore,   al   - though   the     earth    re  - move,    We     will    not     be     a   - fraid:   The     LORD     of    hosts   up   - on     our     side     Doth   con   - stant - ly      re   - main:      The     God   of     Ja      - cob’s   our     ref   - uge,    Us     safe - ly    to      main - tain.      
verse      Though   hills   a    - mid     the     seas      be      cast;       Though   wa      - ters    roar - ing    make,   And     trou  - bled   be;      yea,    though   the   hills,   By     swell - ing     seas   do    shake.   Come,   and      be  - hold    what   won  - drous   works    Have   by      the     LORD    been   wrought;   Come,   see   what   des     - o     - la    - tions   great   He     on     the   earth   hath   brought.   
verse      A        riv   - er     is,     whose   streams   do      glad        The      cit     - y       of     our    God;    The     ho    - ly     place,   where - in       the   Lord     Most   high    hath    His    a   - bode.    Un    - to       the   ends    of     all    the     earth    Wars   in    - to      peace   He     turns:     The     bow   He     breaks,   the     spear   He      cuts,   In     fire   the   char  - iot    burns.     
verse      God      in      the    midst   of      her       doth    dwell;      Noth   - ing       shall   her    re   - move:   The     Lord    to     her      an      help   - er    will,    And    that    right   ear  - ly,   prove.   “Be     still,   and   know    that   I      am      God;     A    - mong    the     hea   - then   I          Will    be    ex   - alt     - ed;     I       on      earth   Will   be     ex  - alt   - ed     high.”     
verse      The      hea   - then   raged   tu    - mul     - tuous - ly,         The      king    - doms    mov  - ed     were:   The     Lord    God    ut     - ter   - ed       His   voice,   The    earth   did     melt   for   fear.    Our     God,     who   is      the    LORD   of      hosts,   Is     still   up    - on      our    side;      The     God   of     Ja      - cob     our     ref   - uge     For    ev   - er    will    a    - bide.
