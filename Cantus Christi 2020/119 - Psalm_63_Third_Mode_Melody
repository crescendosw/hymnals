verse      O     Lord,   my    God,   most   ear - nest - ly      I    seek   Your   ho   - ly    face      With - in      Your   house,   a   - gain     to    see    The       glo  - ries   of       Your   grace.   A   - part    from   You    I    long   and    thirst,   And   naught   can    sat   - is   - fy;      I       wan  - der   in    a     des  - ert     land     Where   all     the    streams   are    dry.     
verse      The   lov   - ing - kind - ness   of    my     God     Is   more   than   life   to    me,       So     I       will   praise   You   all      my    days   And       pray   con  - tin    - ual  - ly.      In    You     my     soul   is   sat  - is   - fied,     My    dark   - ness   turns   to     light,   And     joy  - ful   med - i   - ta   - tions   fill     The     watch - es     of        the    night.   
verse      Be  - neath   the   sha  - dow    of    Your   wings   I    sing   my     joy    and   praise.   Your   right   hand   is       my    strong   sup - port   Through   trou - bled   nights   and    days.    All   those   who    seek   my   life   will   fall;     My    life     is     in      Your   hand.    God’s   king   and   peo - ple   will   re    - joice;   In      vic   - t’ry   they      will   stand.
