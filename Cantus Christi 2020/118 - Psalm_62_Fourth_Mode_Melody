verse      Yet   shall   my     soul    in    si    - lence   still   On     God,     my    help,   at   - ten      - tive   stay:    Yet    He,      my     fort,   my      health,    my    hill,    Re  - move    I      may     not,   move    I     may.     How     long    then   shall    your   fruit - less   will     An      en    - e    - my       so      far     from   fall    With   weak    en    - deav   - or     strive   to     kill,    You    rot   - ten     hedge,   you    bro   - ken    wall?    
verse      For   sooth   that   he      no    more    may     rise    Ad   - vanced   a   - gain    to     throne     and    crown:   To     ru     - in     him     their   thoughts   de  - vise,    And   past    re   - lief    to     tread   him   down.    Their   love    is     on     - ly     love    of     lies:    Their   words   and    deeds    dis   - sent  - ing    so,     When   from    their   lips     most   bless  - ing    flies,   Then   deep  - est     curse    in     heart   doth   grow.    
verse      Yet   shall   my     soul    in    si    - lence   still   On     God,     my    help,   at   - ten      - tive   stay:    Yet    He,      my     fort,   my      health,    my    hill,    Re  - move?   Oh,    no!     Not    move    I     may.     My      God     doth   me       with   glo   - ry     fill,    Not     on    - ly     shield   me      safe    from   harm:   To     shun    dis   - tress,   to     con    - quer   ill      To     Him     I       climb,   in     Him     I      arm.     
verse      Oh,   then    on     God     our   cer   - tain    stay,   All    peo    - ple   in      all    times      re   - ly:      Your   hearts   be   - fore    Him     na       - ked   lay.     To    Ad    - am’s   sons    is     vain    to    fly      So      vain,   so     false,   so     frail   are    they,    Ev’n    he      that   seem   - eth     most    of     might   With   light - ness    self     if     him      you    weigh,   Than   light - ness    self     will   weigh   more   light.   
verse      In    fraud   and    force   no    trust   re    - pose:   Such   i      - dle   hopes   from   thoughts   ex   - pel      And    take     good   heed,   if      rich     - es    grows,   Let   not     your   heart   on     rich  - es    dwell.   All     pow’r   is     God’s;   His    own     Word   shows,   Once    said    by     Him,     twice   heard   by     me:     Yet    from    Thee,   Lord,    all    mer    - cy     flows,   And    each    man’s   work     is     paid    by     Thee.
