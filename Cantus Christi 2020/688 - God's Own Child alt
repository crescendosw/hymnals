verse      God’s    own    child,   I      glad  - ly     say    it:     I    am     bap  - tized   in  - to     Christ!   He,    be   - cause   I      could   not   pay      it,     Gave   my     full     re   - demp  - tion   price.   Do       I      need    earth’s   trea  - sures     man   - y?       I         have   one     worth   more     than   an    - y       That   brought   me       sal   - va       - tion   free      Last  - ing     to      e    - ter   - ni   - ty!      
verse      Sin,     dis  - turb     my     soul    no     long - er:     I    am     bap  - tized   in  - to     Christ!   I      have   com   - fort   e     - ven   strong - er:     Je   - sus’   cleans - ing    sac   - ri   - fice.    Should   a      guilt - y         con   - science   seize   me       Since     my     bap   - tism    did      re   - lease   me      In     a         dear     for   - giv      - ing    flood,    Sprin - kling   me      with   Je    - sus’   blood?   
verse      Sa     - tan,   hear     this   pro   - clam - a    - tion:   I    am     bap  - tized   in  - to     Christ!   Drop   your   ug    - ly     ac    - cu  - sa     - tion,   I      am     not      so     soon    en   - ticed.   Now      that   to      the       font    I’ve      tra   - veled,   All       your   might   has     come     un   - rav   - eled,   And,   a       - gainst   your    tyr      - an   - ny,       God     my      Lord    u    - nites   with   me!      
verse      Death,   you    can    - not    end     my     glad - ness:   I    am     bap  - tized   in  - to     Christ!   When   I      die,    I      leave   all   sad    - ness    To     in   - her    - it     Par   - a    - dise!    Though   I      lie     in        dust    and       ash   - es       Faith’s   as   - sur   - ance    bright - ly     flash - es:     Bap  - tism      has      the     strength   di   - vine      To      make    life    im   - mor   - tal    mine.    
verse      There    is     noth   - ing    worth   com  - par  - ing     To   this   life - long    com - fort   sure!     O    - pen  - eyed    my     grave   is    star   - ing;    E    - ven    there    I’ll   sleep   se   - cure.    Though   my     flesh   a       - waits   its       rais  - ing,     Still     my     soul    con   - tin    - ues    prais - ing:    I      am        bap    - tized   in       - to     Christ;   I’m     a       child   of     Par   - a    - dise!
