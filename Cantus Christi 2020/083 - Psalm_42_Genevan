verse      As     the    hart,   a    - bout   to    fal   - ter,     In     its    trem - bling   ag    - o   - ny,     Longs   for     flow - ing    streams   of      wa    - ter,    So,      O      God,    I      long    for    Thee.   Yes,    a   - thirst   for      Thee     I     cry;    God      of     life,   O      when    shall   I         Come   a    - gain      to     stand   be   - fore   Thee     In       Thy   tem   - ple    and    a   - dore   Thee?    
verse      Bit  - ter    tears   of     la   - men - ta    - tion     Are    my     food   by      night   and   day.    In      my      deep   hu   - mil     - i     - a     - tion    “Where   is     now     your   God?”   they   say.    Oh,     my    soul’s   poured   out      in    me,     When     I      bring   to     mem   - o     - ry        How    the    throngs   I      would   as   - sem  - ble,     Shout  - ing   prais - es     in     Thy   tem  - ple.     
verse      O      my     soul,   why    are    you   griev - ing,     Why    dis  - qui  - et    - ed      in    me?     Hope    in      God,   your   faith     re    - triev - ing:    He       will   still   your   ref   - uge    be.     I       a   - gain     shall    laud     His   grace   For      the    com   - fort   of      His     face:     He     will   show      His    help    and    fa   - vor,     For      He    is      my     God    and   Sav  - ior.     
verse      From   the    land    be   - yond   the   Jor   - dan,     With   my     soul   cast    down    in    me,     From    Mount   Mi   - zar    and       Mount   Her   - mon     I        will   yet     re   - mem   - ber    Thee.   As      the   wa     - ters     plunge   and   leap,   Deep     re   - ech   - oes    un    - to      deep;     All    Thy    waves     and    bil   - lows   roar - ing      O’er     my    trou  - bled   soul   are   pour - ing.     
verse      But    the    LORD    will   send   sal - va    - tion,    And    by     day    His     love    pro - vide.   He      shall   be     my     ex      - ul    - ta    - tion,   And      my     song    at     e     - ven  - tide.   On      His   praise   ev’n     in       the   night   I        will   pon   - der    with    de    - light,    And    in     pray’r,   tran - scend - ing    dis  - tance,   Seek     the   God     of     my     ex  - ist  - ence.    
verse      I      will   say     to     God,   my    for   - tress,   “Why   hast   Thou   for   - got   - ten   me?     Why     must    I      pro  - ceed      in      sad   - ness,   Hound  - ed     by      the    en    - e    - my?”    Their   re  - bukes    and      scoff  - ing   words   Pierce   my     bones   like   point - ed      swords,   As     they   say       with   proud   de   - fi   - ance,    “Where   is    God,    your   firm   re  - li   - ance?”   
verse      O      my     soul,   why    are    you   griev - ing,     Why    dis  - qui  - et    - ed      in    me?     Hope    in      God,   your   faith     re    - triev - ing:    He       will   still   your   ref   - uge    be.     I       a   - gain     shall    laud     His   grace   For      the    com   - fort   of      His     face:     He     will   show      His    help    and    fa   - vor,     For      He    is      my     God    and   Sav  - ior.
