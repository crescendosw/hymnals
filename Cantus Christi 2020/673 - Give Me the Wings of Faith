verse      Give   me       the     wings    of      faith    to     rise     With  - in      the   veil,    and     see       The     saints   a      - bove,   how     great   their   joys,   How     bright   their   glo    - ries   be.       
verse      Once   they     were    mourn  - ing     here     be   - low,     Their   couch   was   wet      with    tears;    They    wres   - tled     hard,   as      we      do      now,    With    sins     and     doubts   and    fears.    
verse      I      ask      them    whence   their   vic    - t’ry   came:    They,   with    u   - nit    - ed      breath,   As    - cribe    their    con   - quest   to      the     Lamb,   Their   tri    - umph    to       His    death.    
verse      They   marked   the     foot   - steps   that     He     trod,    His     zeal    in  - spired   their   breast,   And,    fol    - l’wing   their   in    - car   - nate    God,    Pos   - sess     the     prom   - ised   rest.     
verse      Our    glo    - rious   Lead   - er      claims   our    praise   For     His     own   pat    - tern    giv’n;    While   the      long     cloud   of      wit   - ness  - es      Show    the      same    path     to     Heav’n.
