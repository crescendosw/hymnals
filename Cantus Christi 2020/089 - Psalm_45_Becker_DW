And      You,    the     King,    Are    far     more   fair      Than   all     the     sons     Of    mor   - tal    men,     And    grace    Your   God     is    pour - ing      Up   - on      Your   mouth   and    on      Your    lips.      You    have   been   blest     for  - ev    - er;     You   are     the    King   and      blest,   For  - ev    - er     blest,   a      - men.    
verse      So     gird      Your   sword   up   - on      Your   thigh,   O      great    Lord   and      ma    - jes  - tic!     Ride   forth    in      glo    - ry      and      in     strength.   And    in      Your   glo   - ry      rid  - ing,    Be     - cause   of      truth,   Hu   - mil   - i    - ty,       And    right - eous  - ness     You   con   - quer   all.     And    in       Your   rid   - ing   rich - ly       Your   right   hand   teach - es     awe   - some    things.    Your   foes   are    pierced   with   ar    - rows,   And   un    - der    You    they     fall,    They   fall    be   - neath    Your     feet.   
verse      Your   throne,   O      God,    al   - might - y      God,     Your   throne   is     ev     - er    - last - ing.     The    scep   - ter     of       Your    right  - eous   hand        Sus  - tains   Your   right - eous    king - dom.    You      love    the     right    And    hate    all    sin—      So     God,    Your    God      A   - noint - ed     You      And    poured   the    oil     of    glad - ness     Be   - yond    the    rank    of     all     Your    friends.   The    spic - es     of        Your   gar   - ments   Are   cas   - si   - a      and      myrrh    And    al    - oes    deep     and      rich.   
verse      The    spic    - es     came    from   pal   - ac   - es       Of     i      - vory   worked   and     fash - ioned,   And    that     a     - ro     - ma      made     You    glad        To     greet   the    roy   - al      wed  - ding.   King’s   daugh - ters    were     A    - mong    the    maids.    At     Your    right   hand     Did   stand   the    queen,   The    queen    in     gold    of    O    - phir.    O      daugh - ter    hear,   in   - cline   your    ear;       So     now    for  - get       your   peo   - ple,    For - get     your   fa   - ther’s   house    And    take    your   hus    - band’s   name.   
verse      Your   beau    - ty     shall   the    King    de   - sire,    He     is       your   Lord     and     hus  - band,    And    you      shall   serve    Him     all      your   days,       With   glad  - ness   you     shall   wor  - ship.   A        gift    from    Tyre     Her    daugh - ter    brings,   And    so      the     rich     En  - treat   you    now;     They   bring    to     you     pe  - ti   - tions.   A      daugh - ter    to      the    King    is      here       And    gold - en     is        her    cloth - ing,    Em  - broid - ered   here   with     gold,    Em   - broid - ered   now      with     care.   
verse      And    she       is     ush   - ered   to      the    King     In     bright   and    glo    - rious   rai  - ment     And    all      her     brides - maids   fol    - low    her         With   glad  - ness   and     re    - joic - ing.    And      they    shall   come     With - in      the    gates,    The    pa    - lace    gates,   To    see     the    King.    So     do       not    mourn   or    sor  - row,     To     fill    the    place   your   fa    - thers   left       Your   chil - dren   shall     be     princ - es,     And   I       will   mag  - ni     - fy       Your   name    for  - ev     - er     - more.
