verse      It’s     good      to      thank   the    LORD,    To      praise   Your     name,    Most     High!   To        show     Your      love    at      dawn,      Your   faith - ful  - ness        all    night!   The     ten   - stringed   lyre     With   sweet - voiced   lute     and    rip   - pling   harp     Your   praise   in    - spire.   
verse      Your     deeds,    LORD,   made    me     glad.    I’ll    joy      in       what     You’ve   done.   How       great    Your      do    - ings,   LORD!      How    deep    Your   thoughts;   each   one!     Fools   won’t   be         shown;   The    stu   - pid      can’t    ac   - cept    this    truth,   to     him      un    - known!   
verse      Though   sin     - ners    grow    like   weeds,   Ill   - do     - ers      blos   - som      may,    They’re   doomed   to        be      de    - stroyed.   You,   LORD,   ex   - alt       - ed     stay.    LORD,   Your    foes       fall.    See!   How     Your     foes—    vain   e     - vil     men—     are    scat   - tered   all!     
verse      You’ve   raised,   like    ox,     my     horn,    Fresh   oil      poured   on       my       head.   You       made     me        see     the     spies      And    hear    what   plot      - ters   said.    Like    thriv - ing        palm     The    right - eous     grows,   like   ce    - dars    tall     on     Leb    - a     - non.     
verse      Those    plant   - ed      by      the    LORD     Shall   in       God’s    courts   be       seen;   When      old      they’ll   still   bear    fruit      And    flour - ish,   fresh       and    green,   And     loud    pro      - claim    How    up    - right    is       the    LORD,   my      Rock;    no     wrong    in      Him!
