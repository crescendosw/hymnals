verse      The   fool   de   - clares   to     his    own     heart:   “There’s   no     such      one      as     God.”   They      are   cor     - rupt,   their   deeds   are     vile,     Not    one   of    them     does   good.   
verse      Our   God    from   out      of     Heav - en      looks    Up       - on     the       sons     of     men,    To        see   if        an    - y       un    - der   - stands,   If     an  - y     seeks    for    God.    
verse      No,   they   have   all      be   - come   cor   - rupt,    Each       one    has       turned   his    back;   There’s   no    one       who     does    an    - y       good,     No,    not   a     sin    - gle    one.    
verse      Do    they   not    know     this   is     their   way,     These      work - ers       of       much   sin,    Who       eat   my        peo   - ple     as      their   food,     And    do    not   call     on     God?    
verse      But   they   are    o      - ver  - come   with    dread    When       they   thought   all      was    safe.   God       van - quished   them;   You     made    them    naught,   For    God   has   cast     them   off.    
verse      Oh,   may    de   - liv    - er   - an   - ces     rise     For        Is   - rael      out      of     Zion!   Ja      - cob   will      joy,    yes,    Is    - rael    sing      When   God   re  - stores   His    own.
