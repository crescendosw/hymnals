verse      Rise,    my      soul,    to     watch   and    pray;    From   your   sleep   a   - wak  - en!    Be     not    by      the    e        - vil     day      Un       - a     - wares   o’er - tak   - en;    For     the     foe,    Well   we      know,   Is      a      har     - vest   reap  - ing    While   the   saints   are    sleep - ing.   
verse      Watch    a     - gainst   the    dev   - il’s   snares   Lest   a    - sleep   he    find   you;   For    in   - deed    no     pains      he      spares   To         de    - ceive   and    blind   you.   Sa    - tan’s   prey    Oft    are     they    Who     se   - cure      are    sleep - ing    And     no    watch    are    keep  - ing.   
verse      Watch!   Let     not      the    wick  - ed     world    With   its    lies    de  - feat   you    Lest   with   bold    de   - cep      - tions   hurled   It         be    - tray    and    cheat   you.   Watch   and     see     Lest   there   be      Faith - less   friends   to     charm   you,   Who     but   seek     to     harm    you.   
verse      Watch    a     - gainst   your - self,   my     soul,    Lest   with   grace   you   tri  - fle;   Let    not    self    your   thoughts   con   - trol     Nor        God’s   mer   - cy     sti   - fle.   Pride   and     sin     Lurk   with  - in,     All     our    hopes     to     shat  - ter;   Heed    not   when     they   flat  - ter.

God    pro  - tects   you    day        by      day,     Strength   and     faith   in   - creas - ing.   So      that    still   Mind   and     will    Shall   u    - nite      to     serve   Him    And     for - ev     - er     love    Him.
