verse      In        Zi    - on   we     wait:   O      God,   hear    our   praise;   We’ll   pay     all   we    pro    - mised—   no    faith - less   de   - lays!     To    us       You   are     ti     - tled,    “The   One   Who    Hears   Pray’r.”   All    crea - tures   ap   - proach   You     and    wait   on     You   there.    You   rose   up    in     strength,   and    found - ed     the    hills.   Your   cloth - ing     is     pow    - er;      You    do      what   You   will.   Your   word    calms   the   o     - cean;   the    na     - tions   of      men      Are    stilled   from   their   tu    - mult   a   - gain    and   a   - gain.     
verse      In      - iq    - ui - ties   rise;   on     me     they    pre - vail.     My      heart   is    not   per    - fect;    it    com   - mon  - ly     fails.    But   as       for   trans - gres   - sions,   You    al  - ways   pro   - vide,      And    in     Your    per  - fec    - tions   a      sin  - ner    may   hide.     All   men    who   now    dwell       be   - yond    ev   - ’ry    sea      Will   fear    when    Your   to     - kens     will   cause   them   to    flee.   The    dawn    and     the   sun   - set     will   both     find    their   voice,   You    make      them   go      out     and    in    go    - ing   re  - joice.    
verse      But       blest   is   the    man     whom   You    deign   to    choose    And     cause   to    ap  - proach   You;     He    nev   - er     will   lose.     He    dwells   in    Your    courts   and      he     is    sat  - is    - fied;      Your   tem  - ple     is     ho     - ly      with   good - ness   in  - side.     You   vis  - it    the    earth,      and    bring   in     Your   train    A    - bun   - dance   by     show’r - ing      this   won   - der  - ful   rain.   The    riv   - er      of    God     flows   on     filled   to      the     banks.   It     brings    to     us      grain   and    we    bring   to    You   thanks.   
verse      Through   ter   - ri - ble    deeds   You    an   - swer    our   pray’r,   O       God,    our   sal - va     - tion!    You   an    - swer   our    pray’r.   The   ends     of    the     earth    and      the    far   dis  - tant    seas       Are    giv  - en      Your   signs    and     they   fear   what   You   please.   Our   year   has   been   crowned     with   good  - ness   and    cheer;   Your   paths   drip    a    - bun    - dance;   it     falls   on     us    here.   The    hills   cel   - e   - brate   with    the    cat    - tle     and     grain;   They   shout     and    they    sing    to     the   great   God   of    rain.
