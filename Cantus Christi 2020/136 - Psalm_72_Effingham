verse      O      Lord,   Thy     judg  - ments   give    the     king,    His    Son     Thy       right - eous - ness.    With   right    He      shall   Thy     peo   - ple     judge,   Thy     poor      with      up    - right - ness.   They   in      the   wil   - der    - ness    that   dwell    Bow     down   be    - fore    Him     must;    And   they    that   are     His     en   - mies    Shall   lick    the     ver   - y       dust.    Yea,   He      shall   live,   and   giv’n   to      Him     Shall   be     of    She  - ba’s    gold:    For    Him     still    shall    they    pray,    and     He       Shall   dai   - ly      be      ex   - tolled.   
verse      The    loft  - y       moun  - tains   shall   bring   forth    Un   - to      the       peo   - ple    peace;   Like - wise     the     lit   - tle     hills   the     same     Shall   do        by        right - eous  - ness.   The    kings   of    Tar   - shish,   and     the    isles,   To      Him    shall   pres  - ents    bring;   And   un    - to     Him     shall   of   - gifts   She   - ba’s    and     Se    - ba’s    king.    Of     corn    an      hand  - ful   in      the     earth   On      tops   of    moun - tains   high,    With   pros  - p’rous   fruit    shall   shake,   like    trees    On      Leb   - a     - non     that   be.       
verse      The    peo   - ple’s   poor    ones    He      shall   judge,   The    need  - y’s       chil  - dren   save;    And    those    shall   He      in      piec  - es      break    Who     them      op      - press - ed      have.   Yea,   all     the   might - y        kings   on     earth    Be    - fore   Him     down    shall   fall;    And   all     the    na    - tions   of     world   Do      ser   - vice    to      Him     shall.   The    cit   - y       shall   be    flour - ish   - ing,    Her     cit  - i   - zens   a     - bound    In     num   - ber      shall,   like    to       the     grass    That    grows   up    - on      the    ground.   
verse      They   shall   Thee    fear,   while   sun     and     moon     Do     last,   through   ag    - es     all.     Like   rain     on      mown    grass   He      shall   drop,    Or      show’rs   on        earth   that    fall.   For    He      the   need  - y        shall   pre  - serve,   When    he     to      Him     doth    call;    The   poor    al   - so,     and     him    hath    No      help    of      man     at      all.     His    name    for     ev    - er    shall   en    - dure;   Last    like   the   sun    it      shall:   Men    shall   be       blest    in      Him,     and     blest    All     na    - tions   shall   Him    call.     
verse      The    just    shall   flour - ish     in      His     days,    And    pros  - per       in      His    reign:   He     shall,   while   doth    the     moon    en    - dure,    A     - bun     - dant      peace   main  - tain.   The    poor    man   and     the      in    - di   - gent     In      mer  - cy      He      shall   spare;   He    shall   pre  - serve   a     - live   souls   Of      those   that    need  - y       are.     Now    bless - ed      be      the   Lord    our     God,    The     God    of    Is   - ra    - el,      For    He      a      - lone     doth    won    - drous   works,   In      glo   - ry      that    ex   - cel.      
verse      His    large   and     great   do    - min   - ion     shall    From   sea     to        sea     ex   - tend:    It     from     the     riv   - er      shall   reach   forth    Un    - to        earth’s   ut    - most    end.    Both   from    de  - ceit    and      vi    - o    - lence    Their   soul   He      shall   set     free;    And   in      His    sight   right   pre  - cious   And     dear    their   blood   shall   be.      And    bless - ed      be      His   glo   - rious   name    To      all    e   - ter  - ni    - ty:      The    whole   earth    let      His     glo    - ry      fill.    A     - men,    so      let     it     be.
