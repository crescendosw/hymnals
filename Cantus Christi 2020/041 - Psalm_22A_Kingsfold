verse      My    God,    my      God,   O       why     have   You     For  - sak  - en      me?      O     why     Are     You      so     far   from   giv   - ing    help    And     from    my    groan - ing   cry?     By     day    and   night,   my   God,   I      call;   Your   an  - swer   still   de   - lays.   And    yet    You   are    the   ho     - ly    One     Who     dwells   in     Is  - rael’s   praise.    
verse      Our   fa    - thers   put    their   trust   in     You;    From   You    their   res    - cue   came.   They    begged   You    and   You    set     them   free;   They    were    not   put     to    shame.   But    as     for   me,      I    am     a      worm    And    not   a      man     at     all.    To     men,   I     am     de  - spised   and   base;   Their   scorn  - ings   on    me       fall.      
verse      All   those   who     look   at      me      will   laugh   And    cast   re    - proach   at    me.     Their   mouths   they   o   - pen    wide,   they   wag     Their   heads   in    mock  - er  - y.       “The   LORD   was   his      re - li   - ance   once;   Now    see   what   God     will   send!   Yes,   let    God   rise   and   set      him   free,   This    man      that   was   His      friend!”   
verse      You     took   me    from   my     moth      - er’s   womb    To    safe - ty    at     the     breast.   Since   birth,   when   I      was    cast    on    You,    In     You,     my   God,     I     rest.    Be     not        far    off,    for   grief   is     near,    And   none    to    help     is     found;    For   bulls     of    Ba    - shan   in     their   strength   Now    cir   - cle    me     a     - round.   
verse      Their   li   - on  - jaws   they   o         - pen    wide    And   roar   to    tear   their   prey.     My      heart    is     wax,   my     bones   un  - knit,   My     life     is   poured   a   - way.     My     strength   is     on    - ly    bro   - ken    clay;    My    mouth   and   tongue   are    dry,      For   in        the   ver   - y      dust   of      death      You    there   make   me     to      lie.     
verse      For     see    how   dogs   en   - cir       - cle    me!     On    ev   - ’ry   side   there   stands    A       bro    - ther - hood   of     cru   - el  - ty;     They   pierce   my   feet     and   hands.   My     bones      are    plain   for   me      to     count;   Men   see     me    and      they   stare.    My    clothes   a   - mong    them   they   di    - vide,      And    gam   - ble    for    their   share.   
verse      Now     hur  - ry,   O      my     strength,   to     help!   Do    not    be    far,   O       LORD!     But     snatch   my     soul   from   rag   - ing   dogs    And    spare    me   from     the   sword.   From   li       - on’s   mouth   and   ox    - en’s   horns    O     save    me;   hear     my     pray’r!   And   to        my    breth - ren    in     the     church     Your   name    I      will   de    - clare.
