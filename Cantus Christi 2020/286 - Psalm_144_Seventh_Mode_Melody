verse      Praised   be       the     LORD   of     might,   My         rock   in    all    a    - larms,   By     whom   my    hands    do   fight,   My     fin      - gers     man - age    arms;    My      grace,   my    guard,   my     fort,     On    whom    my      safe  - ty      stays:   To      whom   my      hopes   re   - sort       By     whom    my     realm   o    - beys.    
verse      LORD,     what     is      man    that   Thou     Shouldst   ten  - der   so     his    fare?    What   hath   his   child    to   bow      Thy    thoughts   un     - to    his    care?    Whose   near   - est   kin      is     naught,   No    im    - age     of      whose   days     More    like - ly      can     be     thought,   Than   shade   that   nev   - er     stays.   
verse      LORD,     bend     Thine   arch - ed     skies    With       ease   to    let    Thee   down;    And    make   the   storms   a  - rise     From   moun     - tains’   fum - ing    crown.   Let     fol    - low   flames   from   sky,      To    back    their   stout - est     stand:   Let     fast   Thine   ar    - rows   fly,       Dis  - pers  - ing    thick - est    band.    
verse      Thy       Heav’n - ly      help   ex   - tend     And        lift   me    from   this   flood:   Let    me     Thy   hand     de - fend     From   hand       of       for - eign   brood    Whose   mouth    no    mouth    at     all,      But   forge   of      false   in    - tent,    Where - to     their   hand    doth   fall       As     apt   - est    in    - stru - ment.    
verse      Then   in      new     song    to      Thee    Will   I        ex   - alt    my     voice:    Then     shall,   O      God,     with   me      My      ten  - stringed   lute     re   - joice.   Re    - joice   in      Him,    I    say,     Who     roy   - al     right   pre  - serves   And     saves   from    sword’s    de   - cay      His     Da      - vid     that     Him    serves.   
verse      O      Lord,   Thy     help    ex    - tend,   And    lift     me     from   this   flood:    Let      me       Thy    hand     de   - fend    From    hand   of         for    - eign   brood    Whose   mouth   no      mouth   at   all,     But     forge   of     false   in   - tent,    Where - to      their   hand       doth   fall     As      apt     - est     in     - stru - ment.     
verse      So     then    our     sons    shall   grow    As     plants   of     time - ly     spring:   Whom     soon     to     fair   - est    show    Their   hap  - py         growth   doth   bring.   As      pil   - lars    both    do   bear     And     gar   - nish   king  - ly     hall:    Our     daugh - ters    straight   and    fair,    Each    house     em    - bel    - lish   shall.    
verse      Our    store   shall   aye     be      full,   Yea,   shall    such   full - ness   find,     Though   all      from   thence   we     pull,   Yet     more   shall      rest     be   - hind.    The     mil   - lions   of      in - crease   Shall   break   the    wont  - ed     fold:    Yea,    such    the     sheep    - y      press,   The     streets   shall   scarce - ly     hold.     
verse      Our    herds   shall   brave   the     best;   A    - broad    no     foes   a    - larm;     At       home     to     break    our    rest,   No      cry,   the        voice    of     harm.    If      bless - ed      term    I    may      On      whom    such   bless - ings   fall:    Then    bless - ed,     bless    - ed     they     Whose   God       the     LORD     they   call.
