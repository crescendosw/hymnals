verse      Why     do       the     heath - en    na    - tions   vain - ly   rage?    What   pride - ful   schemes   are    they    in     vain    de  - vis   - ing?   The    kings   of    earth   and   rul  - ers   all   en  - gage     In     e   - vil     plots,   and   in   their   sin   con - triv  - ing,      They    take    their   stand   a    - gainst   our   GOD’s   Mes  - si   - ah;      They   claim   they    will    not    keep     His    bind - ing   chains.   The    One     en  - throned   in     high  - est    heav - en,   high - er,      Mocks   them   to    scorn,   on    them     de   - ri  - sion    rains.   
verse      He      speaks   to      them    in    right - eous,   ho   - ly   wrath;   God    vex   - es    them      and    shows   His    great   dis - pleas - ure.   “Yet   so      I     set     My    King   up  - on    the   path     That   up  - ward    wound    to    Zi - on,     My    own   treas - ure.”     “‘You   are     My      Son,    to   - day      You   are     be   - got  - ten,’—   I      will    de    - clare   what   God      has    said   to    Me—       ‘And   not     one   tribe     will   ev    - er     be     for - got  - ten.     You     will   re  - ceive    the   world,   just   ask   of      Me.’”    
verse      “‘The   na     - tions   come;   You   are     the     on   - ly   Heir,    The    ends    of    earth     will   be      Your   own     pos - ses   - sion   And    bro   - ken   with    a     rod    of    i   - ron   there,   Re   - bel - lious   pot    - ter - y    comes   to    de  - struc - tion.’”   Now     serve   the     LORD,   with   fear     and   glad  - ness   trem - bling,   And    there - fore,   O       ye     kings,   seek   wis  - dom   here.     How    blest   are   those     who    trust   with - out    dis - sem  - bling,   Who     kiss   the   Son      and   bow      in     rev - erent   fear.
