verse      Un   - to     Thee,   O     LORD,   my    Sav  - ior,    I       lift   up      my     wait  - ing    soul.   O     my      God,   in    Thee   I     trust  - ed;     Let     no     shame   now   o’er    me    roll.   On     my     en    - e    - mies    be    shame,   Oft     with - out     a       cause   trans - gress - ing;    But     all   those    who     trust   Thy   name     Hon   - or     with   a     - bun   - dant   bless - ing.    Who,    then,   fears   the    LORD    sin   - cere - ly     Walk  - ing   with    Him     day      by     day?       God     will   lead   him    safe  - ly    on   - ward,   Guide   him   in      the    cho - sen     way.       Then    at    ease   his    soul    shall   rest,    In       the   LORD   his   God    con - fid   - ing;     And    his    chil  - dren    shall   be     blest,   Safe  - ly      in    the    land    a    - bid    - ing.    
verse      Show   Thou   un    - to    me,     Thy   ser  - vant,   All     Thy    ways    and    teach   Thou   me,     So    that,   by     Thy   Spir - it    guid   - ed,     Clear - ly     I       Thy   paths   may   see.    In     Thy    truth   wilt   Thou    me    guide,   Teach   me,    God     of      my      sal   - va    - tion;   All     the   day      for     Thee    I     bide,    LORD,   with   ea   - ger     ex    - pec  - ta    - tion.   To      His     peo   - ple,   who     re    - vere   Him,   Has     the   LORD    His     friend - ship   shown,     And     He     will   to     all     who   fear   Him     Make    His   stead - fast   cov - ’nant   known.     With    a     con  - fi   - dence   com   - plete,   Toward   the   LORD   my    eyes   are   turn  - ing.     From   the    net     He’ll   pluck   my     feet;    He      will    not   de   - spise   my     yearn  - ing.    
verse      Wilt   Thou   then,   I     pray,   be    mind - ful     Of      Thy    mer   - cies   man   - i    - fold,   Of    Thy     care   and   lov  - ing - kind   - ness    Which   have   ev    - er    been    of    old.    Sins   of     youth   re   - mem   - ber   not,     Nor     re   - call    my      hid     trans - gres  - sion;   For     Thy   good   - ness’   sake,   O     LORD,    Think   of     me     in      Thy     com  - pas   - sion.   Turn    to      me      and    show    Thy     fa   - vor;   I       am    lone  - ly      and      dis  - tressed.   From    my     trou - bles   me      de  - liv  - er;     Save    me,   for     I      am    op    - pressed.   Heal    the   sor  - rows   of      my      heart    And      re  - gard   my    life   as    pre   - cious.   Thou   who    my      De    - liv   - ’rer   art,     Bring   me      out   of     my      dis  - tress  - es.     
verse      He,    the    LORD,   is    good    and   up   - right   In      His    deal  - ings   ev    - er   - more.   Sin - ners    are    by    Him    in  - struct - ed      In      the    way     un  - trod    be  - fore.   He     will   ev    - er     guide   the   meek     In      His    judg  - ments   true    and     ho    - ly,     Teach   His   ways     to      those   who   seek     With    a      con  - trite   heart   and    low   - ly.     Look    up    - on      my     great   af    - flic - tion   And     my    trou  - bles,   LORD,    be   - hold;      Grant   me     full   and    free    re  - mis  - sion    Of      my    tres  - pass - es    un    - told.      See     my    en   - e    - mies,   for     great    Is       the   num  - ber   that   up  - braid   me;      Who,   in     their   con   - sum   - ing    hate,    With    their   cru - el     scorn   have   flayed   me.     
verse      All    the    paths   the   LORD    has   cho  - sen     Speak   of     truth   and    mer   - cies   pure    Un  - to      such   as    keep   His   cov    - ’nant   And     His    tes   - ti  - mo    - ny    sure.   For    the    glo   - ry     of      Thy   name,    Par   - don,   LORD,   my      e     - vil   - do    - ing;    Griev - ous   though   my      sin     and   shame,   Hear    my     cry,   Thy     love    re   - new   - ing.    Guard   my      life,   O      gra   - cious   Sav  - ior;   Come,   I     pray,   de    - liv    - er     me,        Lest    my     head   with   shame   be    cov  - ered,   For     my    re    - fuge   is    in      Thee.      Trust - ing   in     Thy    pow’r   su    - preme,   LORD,    I     wait   for   Thy    sal - va    - tion;    God,   come   quick - ly      to      re   - deem     Is    - ra    - el    from   trib  - u    - la     - tion.
