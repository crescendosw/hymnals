The    wa     - ter     of      your     bap  - tism   day      Re   - stored   a    - gain     what - ev   - er       Old    Ad   - am     and     his     sin     de   - stroyed   And      all     our     sin    - ful   selves   em   - ployed   Ac  - cord   - ing     to       our      na     - ture.   
verse      In    bap   - tism    we      now    put      on     Christ—   Our   shame    is     ful     - ly    cov  - ered    With   all      that    He      once     sac  - ri   - ficed    And    free   - ly     for      us     suf  - fered.   For    here   the    flood   of      His     own    blood     Now      makes   us      ho     - ly,   right,   and    good     Be  - fore     our     Heav’n - ly       Fa     - ther.

When   noth - ing    else    re    - vives   your   soul,     Your     bap   - tism    stands   and   makes    you    whole    And   then     in      death    com    - pletes   you.
