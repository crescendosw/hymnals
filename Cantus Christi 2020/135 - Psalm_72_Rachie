verse      Give   the     king    Your    judg - ments;   God,   Your   right - eous - ness.    May   the    Son     of      Da   - vid     all     Your   laws   pos - sess.     He      will    judge   Your   peo  - ple,    just  - ly     rule    the     poor,     Thus    on     hills   and     moun  - tains   will    your    peace   en    - dure.    He   shall   have   do - min - ion—   rule   from   sea   to   sea—   All   the   earth   will   bow   be - fore   His   ma - jes - ty.   He      will    save   those    cry - ing   with   no      one    to    heed.    He       will    spare   the    help  - less,   sav  - ing     souls   in    need.   He      will    yet      re  - deem   them    from   op  - pres - sion’s   blight,   For     their   blood     is     pre - cious   in    His    ho    - ly      sight.   He   shall   have   do - min - ion—   rule   from   sea   to   sea—   All   the   earth   will   bow   be - fore   His   ma - jes - ty.   
verse      He     will    bring   forth   just - ice      to     each   need  - y      son.     He    will   save    their   chil - dren,   crush   each   bru  - tal   one.      They    shall   fear    be   - fore   You     till    the    sun’s   no      more—     While   all    gen   - er    - a     - tions   on      the     earth   en    - dure.
