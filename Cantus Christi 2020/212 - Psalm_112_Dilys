verse      The   man     of      rev   - er  - ence   to    God       Is    bless  - ed    in        the    high - est    class;   His   read  - y      feet    with   joy      are     shod,   To    bring    the   word     to     pass.      His   seed    shall   might - y       pow’r    in   - vest.    And   gain    on       earth   the    first   re   - pute,    And    all   the     branch - es    shall   be      blest    Of    such   a      faith  - ful   root.     
verse      His   soul    shall   have    her   full   re  - past      Of    wealth   and   earth’s   a    - bun  - dant   store.   And   his     in   - teg   - ri   - ty       shall   last    In    Heav’n   for   ev     - er   - more.      The   good    mid     Sa    - tan’s   dark     do   - main     The   day   - spring   has     be   - fore    his    view,    Such   are   be    - nev    - o   - lent    in      grain,   And   lov  - ing,   kind     and   true.     
verse      A     good    man     is      a     com  - mon   friend,   And   in       all   char    - ac   - ters   com  - plete.   He    will    be     mer   - ci   - ful      to      lend,   And   in       his   words    dis  - creet.     For   he      shall   nev   - er      change   his    side,    But   still   keep     stead - fast   and     the    same,    And    God   the     hon    - est   man     shall   guide    To    sem  - pi   - ter    - nal   fame.     
verse      His   spir  - it      shall   not   be     dis - mayed     At    e      - vil   tid     - ings   un   - a    - wares.   And   his     firm   heart   to     Christ   his     aid     Sub - mits     his   soul’s   af   - fairs.     His   heart   no      al    - ter   - a      - tion   knows,   Nor   is      from     God     to     Be    - lial   waved;   And    his   de    - sire     up  - on      his     foes     Is    that   they   should   be    saved.    
verse      His   world - ly      goods   un  - to     the   poor      He    hath     dis - trib    - ut   - ed     a    - round;   His   worth   for    ev    - er     shall    en    - dure    In    ex     - al  - ta     - tion   crowned.   The   wick  - ed      shall   be    - hold     his    rise.    And   learn   and      im    - i    - tate    his    ways,    Till   all   their   en     - vy,   all     their   vice     Sub - side   in     pray’r   and   praise.
