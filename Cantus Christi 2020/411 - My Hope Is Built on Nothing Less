verse      My     hope    is      built   on     noth  - ing   less     Than   Je   - sus’   blood   and   right - eous - ness;    I         dare   not   trust   the    sweet - est     frame,   But     whol - ly     lean    on     Je   - sus’   name.     On   Christ,   the   so - lid   Rock,   I   stand;   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand,   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand.   
verse      When   dark  - ness    seems   to     veil    His   face,    I      rest   on     His     un  - chang - ing    grace;   In        ev   - ’ry   high    and    storm - y       gale,    My      an   - chor   holds   with - in     the    vail.     On   Christ,   the   so - lid   Rock,   I   stand;   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand,   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand.   
verse      His    oath,   His     cov   - e    - nant,   and   blood,   Sup  - port   me     in      the   whelm - ing    flood;   When      all    a   - round   my     soul    gives   way,     He      then   is     all     my     hope   and    stay.     On   Christ,   the   so - lid   Rock,   I   stand;   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand,   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand.   
verse      When   He      shall   come    with   trump - et    sound,   Oh,    may    I      then    in    Him     be     found;   Dressed   in     His   right - eous - ness    a     - lone,    Fault - less   to     stand   be   - fore   the    throne.   On   Christ,   the   so - lid   Rock,   I   stand;   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand,   All   oth - er   ground   is   sink - ing   sand.
