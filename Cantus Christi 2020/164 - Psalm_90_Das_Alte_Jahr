verse      Lord,   You    have   been     our     dwell - ing   place    Through   all    the    ag    - es   of      our    race.     E    - ven     be   - fore    the    moun    - tains’   birth,   Be   - fore     the    time    You    formed   the   earth,    From   years   which   no        be  - gin  - ning   had       To      years   un   - end   - ing,   You     are    God.     For   our     life’s   years   are   sev   - en   - ty,     Or     eight - y     years    the    strong   may     see.    Our    years   at      best    are   toil   and    woe,    How   soon   they   end,    and     then   we    go.     Who    has    Your   an   - ger    un   - der   - stood?   Who     fears   Your   fu  - ry        as     he     should?   
verse      You     turn   man    back     to      dust    a   - gain,    You       say,   “Re  - turn,   O    sons    of     men.”     To     You     a      thou  - sand   years     will     last     Like   yes    - ter  - day     when   it       is    passed;   A      thou  - sand    years     are   in     Your   sight     Brief   like    the    watch - es     of      the    night.   Oh,   teach   us       how     to    count   our    days    And    set     our   hearts   on     wis    - dom’s   ways.   How    long,   O       LORD?   O     now    re   - turn    And   for    Your   ser   - vants   show   con - cern.   Each   morn - ing    fill   us     with   Your    grace;   We’ll   sing    for    joy   through   all    our    days.     
verse      You,    like   a      flood,   swept   men     a   - way,     Till      in     the    sleep   of   death   they   lay;      They   are     like   grass   that   sprouts   a      - new      With   blades   of     green   in     morn   - ing   dew.      At     morn    it      sprouts   to    grow   and    rise,     When    eve   - ning   comes   it     fades   and    dies.    As    man   - y        days    as    we      have   spent   Un   - der     af  - flic   - tion   You      have    sent,   For    all     the     years   we    e    - vil    knew,   Now   make   us     glad;   our     joy    re  - new.    Your   work   to     all    Your   ser  - vants   show;    Your    glo   - ry     let   their     chil - dren   know.     
verse      For     by     Your   an     - ger     we’re   con - sumed,   And       by     Your   wrath   to   ter   - ror    doomed.   You    place   our    sins    be   - fore      Your     sight,   Our    se     - cret   sins    You    bring    to    light.    For    in      Your    wrath     our   days   de   - crease,   And     with    a      sigh    our    years   then   cease.   On    us      may      there   be    shed    a    - broad   Good   fa    - vor   from     the    LORD     our     God.    What   our     hands   made,   es  - tab  - lish   sure,   So    that   our    la    - bors    may    en  - dure;   Yes,   may    the    la   - bor    of     our     hands    Be      made    by     You   to        ev   - er     stand.
