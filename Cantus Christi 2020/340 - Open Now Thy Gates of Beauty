Oh,    how    bless  - ed    is     this      place,   Filled   with   sol  - ace,   light,   and   grace!    
verse      Gra    - cious   God,     I     come     be   - fore    Thee;   Come   Thou   al   - so    un   - to    me;      Where   we   find    Thee    and      a    - dore    Thee   There   a       Heav’n   on      earth     must    be.       To     my     heart,   O     en   - ter       Thou;    Let      it     be     Thy    tem    - ple   now!      
verse      Here     Thy     praise   is    glad   - ly     chant - ed;     Here   Thy    seed   is    du   - ly    sown;    Let     my   soul,   where   it       is     plant - ed,    Bring   forth   pre    - cious   sheaves   a     - lone,     So     that   all      I     hear   may       be       Fruit  - ful    un   - to     life     in    me.       
verse      Thou     my      faith    in  - crease   and    quick - en,     Let    me     keep   Thy   gift   di  - vine;    How   - so - e’er    temp  - ta     - tion   thick - en,    May     Thy     Word     still   o’er      me      shine     As     my     guid   - ing   star   through   life,    As       my     com  - fort   in       all   strife.
