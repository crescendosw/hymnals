verse      O      Is    - rael’s   Shep   - herd,   hear     our   plead - ing,   O       Thou   who    Jo   - seph’s   flock   art   lead - ing,    En    - throned   a   - bove    the   cher - u      - bim!    Shine   forth   be    - fore    Thine   Eph   - ra    - im,      Show    Ben - ja  - min,     Ma    - nas   - seh   light!   Come,   save    us,     God!   Stir   up    Thy    might!   Why    didst   Thou   break    its     walls   a    - sun - der?    All     who    pass   by     its    fruit   can   plun - der.    Thy    vine   is     rav   - aged   by       the     boar,   And    oth  - er    beasts   de     - vour    still   more.    Turn   Thou,   O       God,    and   show   Thy     face;    Look   down   up   - on      Thy   vine   in    grace.   
verse      How    long    wilt     Thou     with    in     - dig - na    - tion   Ig    - nore   Thy    peo  - ple’s    sup   - pli - ca   - tion?   Tears   are       the   bread   of    Is   - ra     - el;     Thou    giv   - est     tears   to      drink   as      well.    Thou    mak - est   us       to      suf   - fer   scorn;   Our     neigh - bors’   jeer - ing    we    have   borne.   O      God     of     hosts,   grant   pre   - ser  - va  - tion;   Pro   - tect   Thy    vine   from   dev   - as  - ta   - tion.   For    they   with   fire    have   burned   the     vine    And    cut    it    down,    though   it      was     Thine.
