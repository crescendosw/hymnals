verse      O     lit    - tle    town    of    Beth - hem,   How   still   we      see    thee   lie!     A     - bove   thy    deep     and   dream - less   sleep    The     si    - lent   stars   go       by.       Yet   in     thy   dark     streets   shin - eth    The   ev    - er   - last  - ing     Light;   The     hopes   and     fears   of   all     the    years   Are   met     in       thee   to   - night.   
verse      For   Christ   is     born    of    Mar  - y,     And   gath  - ered    all    a    - bove,    While   mor  - tals   sleep,   the   an    - gels   keep     Their   watch   of     won   - d’ring   love.     O     morn - ing   stars,   to      - geth - er     Pro - claim   the    ho    - ly      birth,   And     prais - es      sing    to   God     the    King,   And   peace   to       men    on     earth!   
verse      How   si     - lent - ly,     how   si   - ly     The   won   - drous   gift   is     giv’n!   So      God    im   - parts    to    hu    - man    hearts   The     bless - ings   of      His      Heav’n.   No    ear    may   hear     His       com  - ing,   But   in      this   world   of      sin,     Where   meek    souls   will    re - ceive   Him,   still   The   dear    Christ   en   - ters   in.      
verse      O     ho     - ly     Child   of    Beth - hem,   De  - scend   to      us,    we     pray;    Cast    out    our    sin,     and   en    - ter    in;      Be      born    in     us      to     - day.      We    hear   the   Christ - mas       an   - gels   The   great   glad   ti    - dings   tell;    O       come    to      us,     a  - bide    with   us,     Our   Lord    Em     - man  - u    - el!
