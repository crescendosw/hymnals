verse      O     LORD,   I     love    You,    God,   my       strength,   You   are      my    rock     and    for  - tress,   In    You      I      trust,   sal - va     - tion’s   horn,   My      buck     - ler    and     high   tow   - er.       I       call   on      the     LORD;     His     worth    I       will   praise;   I     call     on      my      God.    From    en      - e   - mies   a     - round    My    God       saves   and       de    - liv   - ers.    
verse      Sor - rows    of    death   en    - com  - passed   me,         The   snares   of    death    came   af   - ter.     In    my       dis  - tress,   I     called   to       God;    His     tem      - ple    heard   my     fal   - t’ring.   Earth   trem - bled    and     shook,    God’s   wrath    came    a    - live      And   then     smoke   and     fire    Came    forth,    His   nos  - trils   flared   And   fier    - y       coals     were    kin   - dled.   
verse      He    bowed   the   hea   - vens    down   as       well;       He    came,    and   walked   on     dark - ness,    His   steed,   a      cher   - ub,   wings    of       wind,   And     dark     - ness   His     pa   - vil   - ion.      Dark    wa   - ters,   thick   clouds,   And     bright - ness    and    fire      All   passed   be    - fore    God.    These   coals     of    fire   and     hail     And   clouds,   all     praised   His     glo   - ry.     
verse      The   LORD    has   thun  - dered   out    His      voice,      The   High   - est   spoke    and    shat - tered    All   earth    with   hail     and   coals    of       fire,   His     ar       - rows   fell    as     light - ’ning,    He      scat - tered   all     those     Who     hat    - ed      His    voice,    He    scat   - tered   their   lies;   And     riv     - er  - beds   re    - veal     The   earth’s   foun  - da      - tions   dried   up.     
verse      God   sent    His   ho    - ly      help   to       me;         He    drew     me    from     the    wa   - ters,    God   saved    me     from     my    en     - e      - mies,   Whose   strength   was    far     be   - yond    me.       The     e    - vil     day     brought   Their   mis    - chief   to     life      But   GOD      was     my      stay    He      brought   me    out    to      life     And   light,    for     I         de    - light   Him.    
verse      Ac - cord  - ing   to     my     right - eous - ness     My    GOD     re - ward - ed    rich - ly.     The   clean - ness   of     my     hands     and    heart       Has   meant     He      brought   this   bless - ing.      With    wick - ed   - ness   gone,    I      can    - not    de   - part     From   God’s   gra - cious   law      For    all     His    laws    were   held,     My    hand     has   held    them   tight - ly.    And    God’s   right   hand    has   held   me      up,         And   gave    the    shield     sal  - va    - tion.   He       made   me     great   through   gen   - tle - ness,   My   steps    now   can  - not   fal   - ter.   My     foes       are    pur - sued;   They   run     till   they   fall;    I     wound - ed    them    there.   Be  - fore    they   all    could   rise,   So     now       my    foes    have   fal  - len.    
verse      Up - right   be  - fore   the    Lord    I      stood    And   this    He   has    re  - ward - ed.     The   mer   - ci   - ful    find   mer     - cy     now,        And   up      - right   men       will   see     Him.      And     pur  - i    - ty     gives    True   ho     - li   - ness   sight    To     see     the   true    God.     Some   think   that   He      is     hard;     Our   God      can   break   the    haugh - ty.    For    You     have    gird  - ed    me     with    strength,   You   gave    me     strength   for    bat   - tle.    You      gave   the    necks   of        en    - e   - mies,   Of   them     who   dy   - ing   hate    me.    They   cried      out    in    loss    But    no      one    has    heard,   And   God     an  - swers   not.     I     beat    them   fine   like    dust,   And    down      to    earth   I      cast   them.   
verse      My   can   - dle   God    will   al    - ways   light,   And   chase   a  - way    the   dark - ness.   By    Him     I      have   run    through   a      troop,      And   crossed   the     wall      by     leap  - ing.      God’s   way    is     the    right,   His    words    are    all    true.    His    way     is    the     right.   He     is      a      buck  - ler    strong,   A     shield   for   those   who    trust   Him.   And    You     have    saved   me    from   their   wiles,      The   striv - ings   of         the    heath - en,     And      You    have   made    me        head    and   lord    Of   those    who   have   not   known   me.    They   hear       and    o   - bey,    Sub  - mit     to     my     name,    And   bow     to    my      rod.     The   heath - en     all    shall   fade,   They   are       a   - fraid   in     sec  - ret.    
verse      So   who     is    God    ex   - cept    the    LORD?    Who   is      a    rock   be  - side   Him?    He    is      the    One    who    girds     with   strength,   And   keeps     my      way       es   - tab   - lished.   As      sure - foot - ed     hinds    On     great,   rock - y      crags,   He     stead - ies   my      feet.    As     bows    of     steel   are    bent,     He    trains   my    hands   for    fight - ing.   Lord   God,    You     are     the   liv  - ing     Lord;       I     bless   the    Rock       most   ho    - ly.     Praise   Him,   the    God     who       saved   me    here,   My   shield   and   my     a   - ven   - ger.   And    snatched   from   the   fire,   I      thank   my     God    now;     For   Da    - vid   is      saved.   He    shows   His    kind - ness    now,    To     Christ,   His   seed    for  - ev   - er.
