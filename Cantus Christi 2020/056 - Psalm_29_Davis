verse      Give   un    - to       God,      you   might - y     ones,    give    glo  - ry       and   strength!   Give   all      that   is    due    to    His    name.    In     beau   - ty      of     ho       - li   - ness   wor - ship    Him    now     And   let    all    the    earth   His    glo   - ry   ac  - claim.   
verse      His    sov   - ’reign   and       ma  - jes   - tic   voice    is      o    - ver      the   deep:       He     thun   - ders   the   glo  - ri  - ous    Word.    He     speaks   and     we     hear       His    om   - nip - o     - tent   call    And   on     all    the    wa    - ters   glo   - ry   is    heard.   
verse      The    ce    - dars     of        all   Leb   - a   - non      break   un   - der      His   voice.      He     splin  - ters   the   for  - est - ed     hills.   Like   year   - lings   they   skip,      and    like   ox  - en      they   run—    And   the    burn - ing    flame   di   - vides   as   He    wills.   
verse      His    voice   can      shake     the   wil   - der - ness;    the     de   - sert     is    filled.     His    Word     caus - es    deer   to    give   birth.   He     strips   for   - ests   bare;      in     His    tem - ple     we     cry     And   sing   “Glo - ry!”   to      the    Lord    of   the   earth.   
verse      He     sits    en     - throned   a   - bove    the   flood;   the     Lord   reigns   as    King.       He     reigns   as     a     King   ev  - er   - more.    His    peo    - ple     are    strength   ened   with   His   might - y      hand,   So    for    all    His    bless - ings   let     us   a   - dore.
