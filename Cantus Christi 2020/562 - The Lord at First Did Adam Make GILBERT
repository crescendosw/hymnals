verse      The   Lord   at    first   did    A    - dam   make    Out     of      the    dust     and    clay,   And   in    his   nos    - trils   brea - thed   life,   Ev’n   as     the   Scrip - tures   say.     And     then    in    E    - den’s      pa   - ra  - dise     He     pla   - ced   him    to    dwell,    That   he     with - in     it     should   re     - main,   To    dress   and   keep   it      well.   Now   let   good   Christ - ians   all   be - gin   An   ho - ly   life   to   live,   And   to   re - joice   and   mer - ry   be,   For   this   is   Christ - mas   Eve.   
verse      Now   mark   the   good  - ness   of     the   Lord,   Which   He      to     man    - kind   bore;   His   mer - cy    soon     He      did    ex   - tend,   Lost   man    for   to      re    - store;   And     then,   for   to     re       - deem   our   souls    From   death   and   Hell - ish   thrall,   He     said   His    own    dear   Son      should   be      The   Sav   - ior   of     us      all.    Now   let   good   Christ - ians   all   be - gin   An   ho - ly   life   to   live,   And   to   re - joice   and   mer - ry   be,   For   this   is   Christ - mas   Eve.   
verse      Now   for    the   bless - ings   we     en  - joy,    Which   are     from   Heav’n   a    - bove,   Let   us    re  - nounce   all     wick - ed   - ness,   And    live   in    per   - fect    love;    Then    shall   we    do     Christ’s   own    com - mand,    Ev’n   His     own   writ - ten   Word;     And    when   we     die,   in     Heav   - en       shall   En  - joy     our   liv  - ing     Lord.   Now   let   good   Christ - ians   all   be - gin   An   ho - ly   life   to   live,   And   to   re - joice   and   mer - ry   be,   For   this   is   Christ - mas   Eve.   
verse      And   now    the   tide    is     nigh   at    hand,   In      which   our    Sav    - ior    came;   Let   us    re  - joice    and     mer  - ry     be      In     keep - ing   of      the     same;    Let’s   feed    the   poor   and        hun  - gry   souls,   And    such    as    do     it    crave;    Then   when   we     die,   in     Heav   - en       we      Our   sure    re  - ward   shall   have.   Now   let   good   Christ - ians   all   be - gin   An   ho - ly   life   to   live,   And   to   re - joice   and   mer - ry   be,   For   this   is   Christ - mas   Eve.
