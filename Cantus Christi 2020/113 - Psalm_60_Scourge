Our   Zi     - on    trem  - bles   at     Thy   stroke,   And     dreads   Thy    lift  - ed    hand;   Oh,    heal   the      peo    - ple    Thou    hast    broke,    And    save     the    sink   - ing      land.    
verse      Be    - neath   the    ter      - rors    of      Thine   eye,     Earth’s   haugh - ty      tow’rs   de   - cay;      Thy     frown - ing      man  - tle     spreads   the      sky,    And   mor    - tals    melt      a    - way.      Ex  - alt      Thy   ban   - ner    in     the   field,    For     those    that   fear    Thy   name;   From   bar  - b’rous   hosts    our    na    - tion    shield,   And    put      our    foes     to       shame.

Has   God      de  - sert  - ed     then   our   coast,    And     will     He     not     em  - ploy    His    an   - gel      to       con  - duct    our     host      To     such     a      work     of       joy?     
verse      At    - tend    our    ar       - mies    to      the     fight,   And       be      their   guard  - ian    God;      In      vain    shall    num  - ’rous   pow’rs    u      - nite,   A   - gainst   Thy     lift    - ed     rod.      Our   troops   be  - neath   Thy    guid - ing   hand,     Shall   gain     a      glad    re  - nown:   ’Tis   God    who      makes    the    fee   - ble     stand,    And    treads   the    might  - y        down.
