verse      If      He      spared   not     His   own     dear   Son,    But     gave    Him     for     us    all,     Will   He       not      al     - so     free  - ly      give      Us    all    things,   great   and   small?   
verse      Be    - hold    the      best,   the   great - est    gift,   Of      ev    - er    - last  - ing   love!    Be   - hold     the      pledge   of     peace   be    - low,      And   per  - fect      bliss   a   - bove!    
verse      Where   is      the      judge   who   can     con  - demn    Since   God     hath    jus   - ti  - fied?    Who    shall    charge   those    with   guilt   or      crime     For   whom   the       Sav   - ior   died?    
verse      The     Sav   - ior      died,   but   rose    a    - gain    Tri   - um    - phant   from    the   grave,   And    pleads   our      cause    at     God’s   right   hand      Om  - ni   - po      - tent    to    save.    
verse      Who    then    can    ev   - er    sep   - a     - rate    Us    from     Christ   Je    - sus’   love    Or        break   the   sa    - cred    chain   that   binds    The   earth   to     Heav’n   a    - bove?

verse      Noth - ing     that   is     or    yet     shall   be      And   noth   - ing      in      the    past    Can       ev    - er    cause   God’s   love    to     cease—   He    loves   us     to       the    last.
