verse      Ah,    Je    - sus    Lord,   Thy     love   to    me     No    thought   can    teach,   no     tongue   de   - clare;   O       bind   my       thank - ful   heart   to   Thee     And    reign   with - out     a      ri     - val   there.   Thine,   whol - ly     Thine   a   - lone,   I’d   live;   My   - self    to     Thee   en    - tire     - ly    give.    O       draw   me,      Sav  - ior,    e’er   to   Thee;    So     shall   I       run      and   nev  - er     tire.      With    gra  - cious   words    still   com  - fort    me;      Be    Thou     the    hope,    my     sole    de  - sire.      Free   me     from   ev    - ’ry    guilt   and   fear;    No    sin     can    harm   if      Thou     art   near.   
verse      Oh,    grant   that   noth  - ing     in     my    soul   May   dwell     but    Thy      pure   love     a    - lone.    Oh,     may    Thy      love    pos - sess    me   whole,   My     joy,    my     treas - ure,   and      my    crown!   All      cold - ness   from    my    heart   re  - move;   My     ev    - ’ry    act,   word,   thought,   be    love.    More    hard   than     mar  - ble     is     my   heart,   And    foul    with    sins     of    deep - est    stain;     But     Thou   the     might  - y       Sav  - ior     art,     Nor   flowed   Thy    cleans - ing    blood   in    vain.      Ah,    soft - en,    melt    this   rock,   and   may      Thy   blood   wash   all    these   stains   a   - way.    
verse      O      Lord,   how    gra   - cious   is     Thy   way.   All   fear      be   - fore     The    pres   - ence   flies;   Care,   an   - guish,   sor   - row   melt    a  - way      Wher - e’er    Thy    heal  - ing    hands    a   - rise.    O        Je   - sus,   noth  - ing   may     I     see,    Noth - ing     de   - sire   or      seek,      but   Thee!    Still   let    Thy      love   point   out    my   way;     What   won   - drous   things   Thy   love   hath   wrought.   Still   lead   me      lest     I       go     a     - stray;   Di  - rect     my     work,    in   - spire   my    thought;   And    if     I      fall,   soon   may     I     hear     Thy   voice   and    know   that    love     is    near.   
verse      This   love    un   - wear  - ied     I      pur - sue    And   daunt   - less - ly       to     Thee     as   - pire.    Oh,     may    Thy      love    my    hope    re - new,     Burn   in      my     soul    like   Heav’n - ly    fire!    And      day    and    night   be    all     my    care    To     guard   this   sac  - red     treas    - ure   there.   In      suf  - f’ring   by     Thy     love   my   peace,   In     weak  - ness    be       Thy   love   my     pow’r;     And     when   the     storms   of      life   shall   cease,   O     Je     - sus,   in       that   fi    - nal   hour       Be     Thou   my     rod     and    staff   and   guide,   And   draw    me     safe - ly      to       Thy   side.
