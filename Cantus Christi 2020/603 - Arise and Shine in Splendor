verse      A    - rise      and     shine   in     splen - dor;   Let    night   to      day      sur   - ren - der,   Thy    light   is      draw  - ing   near.    A     - bove    thee,   day     is     beam - ing,   In     match - less   beau  - ty     gleam - ing;   The     glo    - ry     of      the    Lord    is   here.    
verse      See    earth     in      dark  - ness   ly    - ing,   The    heath - en      na     - tions   dy  - ing    In     hope  - less    gloom   and   night.   To      thee    the     Lord    of     Heav - en—    Thy    life,   thy    hope—   hath   giv   - en     Great   glo    - ry,    hon   - or,    and     de - light.   
verse      The    world’s   re    - mot   - est    rac   - es,    Up   - on      whose   wear   - y       fac - es     The    sun     looks   from    the   sky,     Shall   run     with    zeal    un   - tir  - ing,   With   joy     thy    light   de   - sir   - ing    That    breaks   up   - on      them   from    on   high.    
verse      Lift   up        thine   eyes    in     won   - der;   See    na    - tions   gath   - er      yon - der.   They   all     come    un    - to    thee.    The     world   has     heard   thy    sto  - ry;    Thy    sons    come   to      thy    glo   - ry,    And     daugh  - ters   haste   thy    light   to   see.     
verse      Thy    heart     will    leap    for    glad  - ness   When   from    the     realms   of      sad - ness   They   come    o’er    land    and   sea.     Thine   eyes    will    wake    from   slum - ber    When   peo   - ple    with  - out    num   - ber    Come    throng - ing    from    a    - far     to   thee.
