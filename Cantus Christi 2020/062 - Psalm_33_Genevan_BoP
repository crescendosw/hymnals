verse      Re  - joice    ye      in       the   LORD,    O        right - eous,   And     let        a        new       song   fill   the     air.     Praise   is       be   - com   - ing    to      the     up   - right;   With   harp   and     lyre   His    fame     de  - clare.    For     the     LORD    has   spo  - ken     Words   of    truth   un   - bro  - ken;    He      is      faith  - ful     still.   Right - eous   - ness   He    treas  - ures;   Earth   is     with     the    meas  - ures    Of       His     good  - ness   filled.   
verse      He    by       His     Word     has   made     the      heav  - ens;    Their   host       ap     - peared    by     His    de    - cree.    He       gath   - ered   in      His    store - house   cham - bers     The    wa   - ters    of     the    deep   - est   sea.      Let     the     earth   re  - vere   Him     And     its   peo   - ples   fear   Him.    God     spoke   and      ’twas   done.    He      set      all    cre - a      - tion    Firm    on     its      foun - da    - tion.   Praise   Him,    ev    - ’ry  - one!      
verse      God   brings   to      naught   the   na     - tions’   coun  - sel;    He      frus     - trates   all       the    peo  - ples’   plans.   The      LORD     is     stead - fast   in      His     pur  - pose;    For    ev   - er    - more   His    coun   - sel   stands.   Blest   with    His     sal - va   - tion    Is      His   cho   - sen    na   - tion,   For     He      is       their   LORD.    Freed   from     all    op  - pres   - sion,   They    are    His      pos  - ses   - sion.   Let      Him     be      a    - dored!    
verse      The   LORD     looks   from     His   Heav’n - ly       dwell - ing     And     He         be     - holds     the    hu   - man     race;    The      earth    and    all     its    pop   - u     - la   - tion     He     sees   from    that   ex   - alt    - ed    place.    He      knows   ev    - ’ry   na   - tion;   All     are   His     cre  - a    - tion,   And     their   hearts   He      molds.   ’Tis    the      LORD   who   ev     - er      Sees    all    their    en   - deav  - or;     He       their   works   be   - holds.    
verse      No    king     is      saved    by    his      great    ar    - my;     By      strength   the      might   - y      are    not     freed.   A        horse    of     war     will   bring   no      vic  - t’ry;    In     vain   the     war  - rior   trusts   his   steed.    But     the     LORD    our   Sav  - ior     Looks   on    those   with   fa   - vor     Who     His     mer    - cy      trust.   Yea,    though   fam  - ine   grieve   them,   He      will   nev    - er     leave   them    Prey     to      death   and    dust.     
verse      Our   soul     a     - waits    the   great    Re     - deem  - er;     Our     help       and      shield,   Him    we     ac    - claim.   Our      hearts   re   - joice   in     Him     and     glo  - ry,      For    we     trust   in     His    ho     - ly    name.     So      we      hum   - bly   pray   Thee,   Let     Thy   stead - fast   mer  - cy,     LORD,   up    - on       us      be,      And     in       love   de  - liv    - er      Us,     Thy    flock,   for  - ev    - er,     As       we      hope    in     Thee.
