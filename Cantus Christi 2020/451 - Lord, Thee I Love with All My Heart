verse      Lord,   Thee    I       love   with    all    my     heart.   I    pray   Thee,      ne’er   from   me     de - part;   With   ten  - der    mer  - cy   cheer   me.    Earth   has     no     pleas - ure   I      would   share;   Yea,   Heav’n   it - self   were   void    and   bare    If    Thou,   Lord,   were   not   near    me.    And   should   my      heart   for     sor - row   break,   My     trust   in     Thee   no     one    could   shake.   Thou   art        the   por  - tion     I     have    sought;   Thy   pre  - cious   blood   my    soul    has   bought.   Lord   Je - sus   Christ,   My   God      and   Lord,   my   God      and   Lord,   For - sake    me     not!     I      trust   Thy   Word.   
verse      Yea,    Lord,   ’twas   Thy    rich    boun - ty     gave     My   bod  - y,         soul,   and    all    I    have    In     this   poor   life   of   la    - bor.   Lord,   grant   that   I       in    ev   - ’ry     place    May    glo    - ri - fy     Thy    lav   - ish   grace   And   serve   and     help   my    neigh - bor.   Let   no       false   doc   - trine   me    be  - guile;   Let    Sa    - tan    not    my     soul   de    - file.    Give   strength   and   pa   - tience   un  - to      me        To    bear   my      cross   and   fol   - low   Thee.     Lord   Je - sus   Christ,   My   God      and   Lord,   my   God      and   Lord,   In    death   Thy    com    - fort   still   af  - ford.   
verse      Lord,   let     at      last   Thine   an   - gels   come;    To   A    - brah’m’s   bos   - om     bear   me   home    That   I      may    die    un - fear  - ing;   And     in      its    nar   - row   cham - ber     keep     My     bod    - y    safe   in     peace - ful   sleep   Un  - til     Thy     re   - ap  - pear  - ing.   And   then     from    death   a     - wak - en    me       That   these   mine   eyes   with   joy    may     see,     O      Son        of    God,   Thy      glo - rious   face,     My    Sav  - ior     and     my    fount   of    grace,    Lord   Je - sus   Christ,   My   pray’r   at  - tend,   my   pray’r   at  - tend,   And   I       will   praise   Thee   with  - out   end.
