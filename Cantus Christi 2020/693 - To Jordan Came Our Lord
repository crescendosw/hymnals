There   did    He       con    - se  - crate   a       bath    To      wash     a     - way     trans - gres  - sion,   And     quench   the     bit   - ter    - ness   of    death     By     His    own      blood   and    pas   - sion.   He     would   a      new    life   give    us.     
verse      So     hear    ye     all     and     well    per  - ceive    What   God     doth    call    a      bap   - tism,   And     what    a        Christ - ian     should   be   - lieve    Who   shuns   er     - ror      and    schi   - sm:     That    we     should   wa     - ter   use,    the     Lord    De    - clar   - eth     it      His     pleas - ure;    Not     sim    - ply     wa    - ter,     but    the   Word      And    Spir - it       with  - out    meas  - ure;    He     is      the    true   bap  - tiz   - er.     
verse      To     show    us     this    He      hath    His    Word     With   signs   and     sym   - bols   giv   - en;     On      Jor   - dan’s    banks    was     plain  - ly     heard    The   Fa    - ther’s   voice    from   Heav   - en:     “This   is     My       well     be  - lov   - ed      Son,    In      whom     My      soul    de    - light - eth;    Hear    Him.”    Yea,    hear    Him,     ev   - ’ry   one       Whom   He     Him    - self    in   - vit   - eth,    Hear   and     o    - bey    His    teach - ing.    
verse      In     stead - fast   man   - hood,   God     the    Son      In     Jor   - dan’s   wa    - ter    stand - eth.    The     Ho    - ly       Ghost    from    Heav   - en’s   throne   In    dove  - like     form     de   - scend  - eth.    That    thus   the      truth    be    not     de    - nied,   Nor     should   our     faith   e’er    wa    - ver,    That    all      Three   Per   - sons     do     pre - side,     At     Bap  - tism’s   ho    - ly     la    - ver,    And    dwell   with   the    be   - liev  - er.     
verse      Thus   Je    - sus    His     dis   - ci    - ples   sent:    Go,    teach   ye      ev    - ’ry    na    - tion,   That,   lost    in       sin,     they    must     re   - pent     And   flee    from     con    - dem  - na     - tion:   He      that   be     - lieves   and   is      bap   - tized   Shall   there  - by      have    sal   - va    - tion;   A       new    - born    man     he       is     in    Christ,   And    free   from     con   - dem  - na    - tion;   He     shall   in   - her  - it     Heav  - en.     
verse      Who    in      this   mer   - cy      hath    not    faith,   Nor    aught   there - in      dis  - cern  - eth,    Is      yet     in       sin,     con   - demned   to     death,   And   fire    that     ev     - er     burn   - eth;    His     ho   - li     - ness     a   - vails   him     not,    Nor     aught    which   he      is      do    - ing;    His     in     - born    sin     brings   all    to    naught,   And    mak  - eth      sure    his    ru    - in;     Him  - self    he     can  - not    suc   - cor.
