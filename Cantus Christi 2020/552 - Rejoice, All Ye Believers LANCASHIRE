verse      Re  - joice,    all    ye      be  - liev - ers,     And    let     your   lights   ap      - pear;   The     eve   - ning   is      ad  - vanc   - ing,    And    dark - er    night   is   near:     The    Bride  - groom   is       a   - ris  - ing,   And   soon     He    draw  - eth     nigh;   Up,   pray,   and    watch,    and   wres - tle:   At     mid    - night   comes   the   cry.     
verse      See   that      your   lamps   are   burn - ing;     Re   - plen  - ish    them     with      oil;    And     wait    for    your    sal - va     - tion,   The    end    of    earth - ly   toil.     The    watch  - ers     on       the   moun - tain   Pro - claim    the   Bride - groom   near,   Go    meet    Him    as        He    com  - eth,   With   al     - le    - lu    - ias   clear.   
verse      Ye    saints,   who    here    in    pa   - tience   Your   cross   and    suf    - f’rings   bore,   Shall   live    and    reign   for   ev     - er,     When   sor  - row   is      no   more:     A    - round    the     throne   of    glo  - ry     The   Lamb     ye    shall   be    - hold,   In    tri   - umph   cast      be  - fore   Him    Your   di     - a     - dems    of    gold.    
verse      Our   hope      and    ex    - pec - ta   - tion,    O      Je    - sus,   now      ap      - pear;   A     - rise,   Thou   Sun     so    longed   for,    O’er   this   be  - night - ed   sphere.   With   hearts   and     hands    up  - lift - ed,    We    plead,   O     Lord,   to      see     The   day     of     earth’s   re  - demp - tion   That   brings   us      un    - to    Thee.
