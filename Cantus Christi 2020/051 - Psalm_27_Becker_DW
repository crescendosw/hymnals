verse      My       Sav   - ior    God    is       all     my     light,   Whom   shall   I       fear   be   - side   Him?   The      LORD   is      strength,   and    life   and    sight,   I     can  - not   fear    be   - side   Him.    And    when   my     foes     Would   eat     my     flesh,   In     pride   those   foes   have   stum - bled.   Their   ha   - tred   grows,   Their   traps    are     mesh,   But    head - long   they   have   tum  - bled.   
verse      Though   ar    - mies   camp   a      - round   me     here     My     heart   shall   nev  - er     trem - ble.   Though   wars   a     - rise,       I      will   not    fear,    His   grac - es    I       as   - sem  - ble.    I      seek   one    thing:   The     house   of     God,     That   I       may     see    His    beau - ty.     And     I      will   sing     My      praise   to      God,    With   ho   - li   - ness   my     du   - ty.     
verse      In       times   of     trou - ble      I       will   seek     To     hide    in      His    pa   - vil  - ion.   He       sets   me      on          a      moun - tain   peak,    My    God    pro - tects   His    chil - dren.   And    so     my     head     Is      lift  - ed     up,      My     en    - e     - mies   will   suf  - fer.    With    joy    my     bread,   With    praise   my      cup,    My     wor  - ship   I      will   of   - fer.    
verse      O        LORD    my     God,   please   hear    with   grace,   At   - tend    my      fer  - vent   cry  - ing.   As       You    said,   I           will   seek   Your   face,    You   save   my    soul    from   dy   - ing.    Turn   not    Your   face     A     - way     from   me,      Nor    turn    a     - way    in     an   - ger.    Ex    - tend   Your   grace    So      I        might   see;    And    save   me     from   all    dan  - ger.    
verse      My       fa    - ther   and    my       moth  - er     flee,    Yet    still   the     LORD   will   save   me.    Teach    me,    O       God,        that   I      may    see      The   path   of    life    You    gave   me.     With   cru  - el     breath   My      foes    a    - rise,    Full   ha    - tred    they   en   - cour - age.    Spare   me     from   death,   And     from     their   lies.   Wait   on     the    LORD   with   cour - age.
