verse      God    makes   the     grass   grow   to      be    food    for   the    cat - tle     And   makes    ve - ge   - ta   - tion   as    la   - bor   for   man.     So    man     brings   forth   food,   turns    the    earth    to       a       gar  - den,     And    man     grows   the    wine - grapes   that    make   his    heart   glad.   Thus    man    makes   his   face    shine   with   oil    from   the   gar - den,    And     grows   all    the    food    that   sus  - tains   hu   - man   hearts.   
verse      The    trees   of      the     LORD   are     pro - vid   - ed    with   wa  - ter,    The   great    ce - dars   tall   that   in    Le   - ban - on    stand.   The   birds   build    their   nests   there,   the    storks   choose   the     pine   trees.   Wild   goats   climb   high   moun - tains    where   rock   bad  - gers    hide.   The     moon   He      ap  - point - ed      to     mark   off    the   sea - sons;   The     sun     al   - ways   knows   when   it’s   time    to     go    down.     
verse      When   You     bring   forth   dark - ness,   and   night   fol - lows   day - time,   The   beasts   of   the    for  - est    all   come   out   to    prowl.   The   young   li     - ons     roar    when     they   search   for      their   quar - ry,      De   - pend  - ing     on     God    to       pro   - vide   them   with    food.   Then,   when   the     sun   ris   - es,     they   go     in   - to    hid - ing,    While   man     goes   to     work    un   - til    eve   - ning   a   - gain.     
verse      Your   works,   LORD,   are     man   - y,    in      wis   - dom    You   made   them:    The      things   You    cre   - at   - ed,      they   fill    all    the     earth.    And    al - so     the    o    - cean,   how    vast   and   how    spac - ious   Is    teem  - ing    with    crea  - tures   too    man  - y      to     count.   The   ships   are     there   sail - ing;    Le   - vi    - a    - than   lives   there;   You      made    him   to      play      in    the   depths   of       the   sea.    
verse      The    sea      mon   - sters   wait    for   their   meals   from   You   dai  - ly,      And      at       all    their   meal - times,   You    give    them   their   food.     What - ev - er     You    give   them,   they   gath - er    each   mor  - sel,   And   Your    o    - pened   hand    sa    - tis  - fies   them   with   good.    You   hide    Your    face    from   them    and    they    are    con  - found - ed,      You      snuff   out   their   breath,   and   to    dust     they     re  - turn.   
verse      You    send     out     Your    spir  - it,   cre   - at    - ing    sea   mon  - sters,   You’re   al     - ways   re    - mak  - ing      the    face    of     the     ground.   For  - ev - er,    Je   - ho   - vah,    Your   glo  - ry    is     last - ing,   Re  - joice   in     Your    works   and     look   down   on     the    earth.   It    trem  - bles:   the     moun - tains   make   smoke   when   You    touch   them;    I’ll     sing    to    Je    - ho      - vah   as    long     as       I     live.   
verse      To     God      I’ll    sing    prais - es    while   I       have   my    be   - ing,     May      my       med  - i     - ta   - tion     be     pleas - ing    to      Him!      For    I    will   find   all    of      my     joy    in    Je   - ho   - vah,   May   sin   - ners   be      moved   from    the    face   of     the    earth!   And   let     all     the     wick - ed      no     more    have   ex   - ist   - ance.    Praise   be      to    the     LORD,     O     my    soul.    Praise   the   LORD!
