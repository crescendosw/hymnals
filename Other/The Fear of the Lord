verse      The fear of the Lord Our   days    will pro - long;   In    trou - ble   af - ford   A    con    -   fi  -  dence strong;
verse      The fear of the Lord Pre - serves  us   from  death,  En -  forc - es    His  Word,  En - liv    -   ens    our   faith.
verse      The fear of the Lord Is    sound - ness and   health; A     trea - sure  well stor'd With Heav   -   en  -  ly    wealth,
verse      The fear of the Lord Is    clean   and  ap -  prov’d, Makes Sa  -  tan   ab - hor’d  And  Je    -    sus    be -  lov’d.
verse      The fear of the Lord Is    low  -  ly   and   meek;   The   hap  - py    re - ward   Of   all        that   Him   seek.
verse      The fear of the Lord His   mer  -  cy   makes dear,   His   judg - ments a  - dor’d, His  right  -   eous - ness  clear.
verse      The fear of the Lord Con - firms   a    good  hope:   By    this   are   re - stor’d The  sens   -   es     that  droop.
verse      The fear of the Lord For - bids    us   to    yield.  It    shar - pens  our  sword; It   strength - ens    our   shield:

verse      Will   keep   us    from   sin  -  ning; Will pros - per   our     ways;    And    is     the    beg - gin  -  ning  Of  wis -  dom  and  grace.
verse      It     reg -  ul -  ates   pas  -  sion; It   helps  us    to      quell    The    dread  of     dam - na   -  tion  And ter -  rors of   Hell.
verse      A      fence  a  -  gainst e   -   vil   By   which  we    re   -  sist     World, flesh, and    the   de   -  vil,  And im  -  i  - tate Christ.
verse      It     con -  quers by     weak  - ness, Is   proof  a  -  gainst  strife;  A      cor -  dial   in    sick -  ness; A   foun - tain of   life.
verse      They   on  -  ly    that   fear    Him   The  truth  can   dis  -  cern,    For    liv -  ing    so    near    Him   His sec  - rets they learn.
verse      With - out    its   fresh  flav  - or    In   know - ledge there’s fault,   In     doc -  trines no    fa   -  vor,  In  du  -  ties no   salt.
verse      The    deep - er    it     reach - es,   The  more   the   soul    thrives. It     gives  what  it     teach - es    And guards what it   gives.
verse      Then   cry    we    to     Heav  - en    With one    loud  ac   -  cord     That   to     us     be    giv  -  en    The fear   of   the  Lord.
